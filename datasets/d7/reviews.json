Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u0413\u00a9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.","1":"This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  \nThe store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! \nGreat clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). \nChristian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \/ Route 30. 4 stars.","2":"I called WVM on the recommendation of a couple of friends who had used them in the past and thought they did a nice job. I'm a fan now, too.\n\nEvan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours. All of my (heavy) furniture arrived in perfect condition, and they took extra care not to scratch the wood floors in the process.\n\nI hope not to move again anytime soon, but next time I do, I'll be calling WVM.","3":"I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.\n\nThe rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.\n\nWe got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.","4":"The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!","5":"This place used to be a cool, chill place. Now its a bunch of neanderthal bouncers hopped up on steroids acting like the can do whatever they want. There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.","6":"The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close.   The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better.\n\nIt's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.","7":"Probably one of the better breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. I had the EGGMEATMUFFIN, the bread was toasted perfectly and the bacon was a real thick cut. Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!","8":"I am definitely a fan of Sports Authority.  This particular location has a good check in deal.  We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience.  The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for.  We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories.  The store was clean and well organized.  They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between.  Good spot to buy athletic merchandise.","9":"I work in the Pru and this is the most affordable and tasty place in the food court.  deals where a meal is $5-$7 and the chicken pesto is really good.   I am not a chowda person but all there soups I have had are pretty damn good.  Broccoli chicken is my favorite.  Also, probably the most personable Food court staff I have ever had the pleasure of ordering from.","10":"They NEVER seem to get our \norder correct, service is crappy, food is inconsistent and has gone down hill steadily in the last 6-9 months! WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!","11":"Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \n\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.","12":"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.","13":"I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn't know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\n\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician's offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!","14":"This is a five-star restaurant if ever I have seen one! Maurice, one of the owners, met us at the front door, Daniel a seasoned waiter from Hawaii, took care of us and the food was over-the-top delicious. This is not just a restaurant, it is an experience!  My son recommended this to us and we are glad that we took his advice. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the grouper with crab. Save room for dessert! We live in Tallahassee but the next time we are in Orlando it's back to Chatham's!","15":"Quickly stopped in for a UFC fight. I sat down at the bar while my boyfriend parked the car. Although the restaurant\/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \n\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE! Give this girl a raise!!","16":"I loved everything about this place. I've only been once but I keep meaning to go back as it was so great (just a bit out of my way). \n\nI went with a fairly large group so we'd all ordered something different (back when it was $6 for everything, it looks like they've changed that now). At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.\n\nThe real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background! That + board games + good food + mead = I'm a fan forever.","17":"Great coffee and pastries. Baristas are excellent. All the other staff are sooooo lost and vacant.","18":"Nothing special but good enough.  I like another one much better in Dorchester, but hardly get to that area, so Le's is my goto place for Pho","19":"Definitely 5 stars for the donuts.  Our family has been coming to Dandy Donuts for years!  Their donuts can't be beat and are a must-try.   The same Cambodian family has owned this shop for years. They are kind, hard-working folks that put out a consistently fresh and delicious line of donuts as well as croissants and apple fritters their customers love.   \n\nSubs are also good.   I notice they've added a new low-price lunch special of hot dog, chips and drink.  The surroundings are definitely \"hole-in-the-wall\", but go and try the donuts.","20":"I think their rice dishes are way better than their Pho's. Also I really like their sandwiches and spring rolls. I took a friend who haven't had viennese food ever. He absolutely love it.","21":"Best station to fill up around in my opinion. Attendants are super friendly. They also carry bio diesel! Been running this in my Dodge for couple years w\/o any issues. With Safeway right on same corner, the rewards really make this a favorite gas stop. Thanks!","22":"Ordered the original tonkotsu base ramen and a char siu don for my 2 year old.  Loved the soup base but especially loved the size of the bowl...unlike most ramen place, the size of the bowl reflected the quantity of the content in it.  Totally looking forward to going back so I can customize my next bowl of ramen...will select thicker noodle for sure and perhaps add more ramen!\nFabulous service and loved that they had a sign advising ppl to come in, write down name then wait outside, so not to clog the entrance\/exit.\n\nGreat ramen place, but won't go with a group larger than 4 ppl.  Heads up, there was only one high chair.","23":"I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \n\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\n\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.","24":"Almost desolate restaurant and dingy evironment. That's a star.\n\nDecieving lunch menu. (claimed dishes were 550 before 3 on Saturdays and was still charged $2 more) That's a star.\n\nCongealed beef soup. That's a star.\n\nFriend's dish didn't come for 30 minutes after I got mine and he didn't get the soup that came with it. That's a star.\n\nAsked for water 5 times and didn't get of until right before the bill came. That's a star. \n\nWelp, I seem to be out of stars! Whoopsie Daisy! I wanted to be more forgiving since the waitress was new but even the manager who stepped in for her was screwing up. And it doesn't excuse the mediocre food.","25":"I had a 1 hour massage tonight with Barbara. LITERALLY best massage I've had, and I've gotten plenty of massages around the globe. First off, let me say that when Barb asks you the simple questions, she follows through as you please. I hate when I request soft-medium and it's totally opposite. I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it! That's their way of apologizing indirectly! Awesome massage even without the add on! Cannot wait to book my next massage with her!","26":"When we first arrived at the Coco Key, we were greeted by a number of staff members as we checked in, the process was slightly awkward because the staff appeared new or in training, which can happen from time to time. No harm no foul. \nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \nYou're probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \nI am very much alive. However, I am very doubtful that I will ever return to the coco key.","27":"Erika was amazing! After months of trying to find a place on my own, she swooped right in and helped me find the perfect home in a couple of weeks! I couldn't be more excited or grateful!\n\nthanks Erika!","28":"This place is truly a hidden gem (literally hidden as you have to walk through a Chinese restaurant to get there).  The place is small, cozy, and charming inside.  And the food is better than what you might find in the north end.  The service is great and the servers do a great job at pronouncing the specials to you like a true Italian! Make sure you make a reservation as it does book up rather quickly.","29":"Am I crazy for giving anything MBTA-related four stars? Maybe.\n\nRating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US.\n\nSimply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \n\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it.  So knowing all this, I'm still really quite happy with the red line.","30":"3.5 stars! I got the avocado margarita and it was delicious! Customer service was OK, but they were busy. The food was better than expected and the meat wasn't overly salty. I will definitely return!!!","31":"First time being here and I'm not going anywhere else for my truck needs from now on.  Right when I feel like customer service is lacking in my day to day dealings, Miguel and the crew at Lambs turned all that around in a few minutes.  These guys got me in late in the day after work, gave me great advice about my truck without trying to pitch anything, took care of my tire quickly and had me on my way.  This place definitely stands out and I'm for sure coming back for an oil change, rotation, and whatever else I need in the future.  Thanks guys I really appreciate it.","32":"I love ale house. I'm here all the time. The 1 star isn't for the place or for the service. The 1 star is for the management. You give absolutely zero respect to the game of soccer.\n\nI've been coming here since you opened and I've seen numerous times where you understaff for finals of tournaments where years past have shown you will be at capacity. \n\nIt's a shame you have a great establishment and great employees. If only management could sort it out this place would be 5 stars","33":"This has not been a pleasant experience. According to our server, the restaurant is short on staff. This means our service has been frightfully slow. We have been here over an hour with receiving our food. Most of the food was good, except for the steak that was tough. This is a trendy place. Great spot to be seen. Food is just okay.","34":"\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone's- meal comped last night.\n\nYes, I'm doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .","35":"This place has some of the BEST chinese take-out in Portland. Don't let the inside-a-bar vibe scare you away. WE LOVE HAPPY FORTUNE. Just thinking about it makes me want to go there right now. Plus.. they have great prices. \n\nHere's some of our favorites over the years: General Tso's (nice and spicy), the crab puffs, lo-mein. \n\nThe service is great -- cheap drinks, while you're waiting, from plucky, yet-very-nice bartenders. Interesting people watching, but make sure to order from the bar-side of the place for that.","36":"Just had Yalla for lunch today. I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.","37":"Overall Recommendation:  If you like fried chicken, you should definitely check this place out.  Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\n\nPros\n  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with \n    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken \n    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as \n    good.\n  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste\n  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese\n  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.\n\nCons\n  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)\n  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were \n    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.\n  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me\n\n**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.  However if you park on the street, the meters are really expensive...something crazy like $2 an hour.","38":"best pizza on a busy street! my kids love it. i've been recommending to everyone who has a birthday party in that area to order from pizzapalooza and they are not disappointed. the pizza is thick, square and yummY! so many varieties, i love their pasta with meatball too! They also serve ice cream. This is a good value comfort food place for me and my family.","39":"So sad to learn they are demolishing this. Always loved coming here and seeing all the graffiti art work.","40":"Had the worst experience there today when I tried to have a breakfast. The service was slow waited at least 30 min for my French toast and when it got there I pulled a long grosse hair out of it. I'm never going there again!","41":"I wanted this to be a great place, but I wasn't impressed.  I went there for dinner on a Monday.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich--it seemed like a sort of specialty.  My husband had the burger.  The buns left something to be desired.  The fries were okay but a little cold.  But at about $10 per entree for bar food, it wasn't as good as it should have been.  Service was fine--they were overstaffed.  I don't think I will be back anytime soon.","42":"Incredible donuts. Sometimes you have to go early to have the full selection but the donuts never disappoint.","43":"New owner is raising the bar with designer womens clothing.","44":"Kudos to AutoNation! We had an oil change done at another franchise and found our Toyota leaking oil the next day. We took it back to said business and they came up with all kinds of reasons that they weren't at fault. We brought the car to AutoNation, and in less than an hour we were shown that the first place used the wrong type of oil filter. Bravo! faced with the evidence the first place gave us the refund we requested.\n\nThe indoor theater and popcorn are a nice touch too! :D","45":"Dont bother going to voodoo, just come here instead. They have such unique flavors and everything is so fresh. Oh, and try their cold brew too!","46":"Bummer. I was very disappointed.  So I finally stopped in for take out.  I got the fried haddock sandwich with fries.  The fries were frozen and greasy..  The haddock sandwich was not good.  Tasted  very fishy and frozen.  I had such high hopes their take out would be good.","47":"Overall is good, is worth the line up I don't think so, mainly Instagram addict's go here. Believe me the food is great, service is ok, the hype about it I still dont get it.","48":"It's a pleasure doing business with them. Very good service and hospitable staff.","49":"The ramen here is less than great. It came out luke warm and oily. The service we received was NOT good. I will not be returning.","50":"This a great place to go to be social with a group.  I went yesterday and had to wait in line ten minutes just to get in, but no big deal, as the newest addition to Kendall Square the \"new\" factor of State Park delivers on the hype and is worth the wait!\n\nThe place was packed but it somehow did not feel crowded and while we were only there for drinks I will be back for the southern food. \n\nThe bar tenders kept everyone happy in the crowded restaurant and with good Juke Box tunes, fun shuffle board and great decor all of the ingredients were primed for a fun fueled night. \n\nKudos to the female bartender for making me and my friends 8  Moscow Mules and one great dirty Vodka Martini.  The group all agreed - delicious, 8 for 8! \n\nA raucous good time in the always fun and classy Kendall Square.  If you're bar hopping near Inman and Kendall save yourself the walk to Central and crash the party at State Park.","51":"I just got done with lunch here. It has been okay in the past, but today, the service was a failure on multiple levels. First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable. I write in the hopes that you will take corrective action, whether in coaching your staff, or hiring more people for the lunch rush.","52":"This place has everything-I finally found Dogfish 120m IPA! If they don't have it the store, ask if they have it in the back.","53":"Brasserie zero zero... we were hoping for a ten based on how highly recommended it was however, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food. We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. \n\nWe ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing. The ambiance and service was great and we had a yummy creme br\u0413\u00bbl\u0413\u00a9e brought to our table for the birthday we were celebrating but we wished the rest of the meal had lived up to the hype.","54":"Bummer that the price for a ticket to the hotel was the same price as a rental car.  It was an ok ride but we should have just gotten a car.\n\nAlso, you need to walk way down from the desk to the waiting area to catch the shuttle.  Good thing we traveled light.\n\nLesson-ed learned for next time.","55":"My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \n\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\n\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\n\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.","56":"\"Even the mad Captain Ahab is touched by Starbuck's goodness...\"\n  Herman Melville \n\nThe drive-thru was jammed with vehicles when I pulled up, so I opted to park and go to the walk-up window. \n\nThe staff were super friendly! More then a few of them said hello to me while I ordered. Even though they were busy, they were all genuinely smiling. They look like they enjoy their job. Great teamwork! \nI think this is the friendliest Starbucks I've ever visited. \n\nThe building is architecturally pleasing to me so it catches my eye every time I've driven past it. I'm glad I stopped this time.\n\nIt's close to my freeway entrance so I'll be making this a regular stop from now on. If you're in the area, you should too!","57":"We had lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and it was great.  We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and both were uniquely delicious!  The service was great and it was an overall fantastic experience.  Will definitely be back.","58":"Overall can be a great experience if you're a regular and know what you are doing. You pick your car, get in, and you go. However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don't expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\n\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go. The rep will hand you a receipt and you walk to the terminal.","59":"For the price we paid (about $50 for 2 people) the food was only so-so and the service was AWFUL. Our waitress sounded like a robot, and we had to grab another waiter several times because she never came back to check on us. The food came out and it looked like it had been sitting in the back a while, it was barely warm and a film had formed over the top of my ravioli. Overall, very unimpressed and I don't think I would go back or recommend this location to a friend.","60":"Amazing Service!!! Very professional & courteous staff!! The best way to deliver excellent customer service is by following up with your customers and keeping your word helping them.\nTine Hopson and Stephen Cimino provided excellent customer service by following up with me all the time and keeping their word :)  Thank you both of you being so awesome!!!","61":"Seriously, why aren't you at Comfort?\n\nTonight was a special occasion, and we wanted to try something new.  Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.","62":"Fix the Beer.  The hardware is the problem. At least 15 out of the 45 taps are faulty.  Sorry guys, but I have given you 5 years and other customers will notice, Please Scott.","63":"its the best pizza hut i'v found in florida always got great deals & offers the staff are very friendly & make you feel welcome and if you have children with you they make them feel extra special & welcome them in a huge way too","64":"certainly don't come here for the ambiance. it appears like it used to be a walk-up ice cream window in the front, which is semi-camouflaged with curtains. the service is okay - efficient, but not overly friendly or helpful. we mostly stick to the curries here, which are good. often filled with a lot of tufts students during the school year, probably b\/c it is not so crowded and can accommodate larger groups.\n\nsometimes one of the employees (or their family members) are playing an electronic keyboard.","65":"I'm having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.","66":"So my roommate borrowed my clock radio and apparently left it set to this station. This meant I got to wake up to my normal 7 a.m. radio alarm hearing some god awful \"dude-bro\"\/man child apparently named \"Lunchbox\" YELLING literally at the top of his lungs. Gee, can you think of a more UNPLEASANT way to wake up at 7 a.m? I honestly think I would have rather woken up to a cheese grater across my face than listen to this frat-boy douche yelling like a 5 year old having a tantrum in the name of some morning show bit. Then one of the other hosts couldn't even identify a Bon Jovi song playing? Are you kidding me? Where the hell did they find these people and please wherever it was send them back and get them off the damn radio or any job where they are actually required to speak for that matter. As for me I have re-adjusted my radio dial to a different station and banned my roommate from ever borrowing my clock radio again!","67":"It's crazy how establishments on the west coast have so many more yelp reviews than places on the east coast.  I find this extremely fascinating and I wish more people would be as passionate as the west coast has proven to me.\n\nIt was recommended that we go here for brunch...needless to say whomever told me this, is a genius.\n\nFresh brunch food, delicious infused vodka's, awesome buttermilk biscuits.\n\nI ordered the \"roll over\"  two potato cakes that had a egg scramble with delicious sausage that wasn't gross and covered in grease and then all of this was topped with your choice of a bacon gravy or a mushroom and rosemary gravy.  Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried.\n\nI might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished.  The flavors were just right and I was shocked at the lack of greasiness that usual breakfast foods come with and their perfectly prepared dishes were done to my liking!\n\nLastly, make sure you order the biscuit too because it's heaven baked in the oven for your enjoyment.\n\nTake care & savor it up!","68":"Perfect spices, nice atmosphere & music, great lighting and decor. Even the restroom area is pretty cool.  Will definitely come again.","69":"Was not that great. We sat for like 15 mins before getting our drink orders done. We were literally the only table in the restaurant taken. We had like 3 different waiters. Appetizers all came out within like 5-10 min intervals of each other. All 3 of us ordered 2 different rolls and it took like 30 mins to come out. Sushi was alright but I would say to much for the quality.","70":"I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it.  The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.","71":"5 stars for the location, it's absolutely wonderful. I ordered the shamrock bubble tea, which was one of the best I've ever had. I am subtracting a star for service however.  It was the barista that was so put out by waiting on us and then the 10-15 minutes it took to make the bubble tea... That's a bit long for a drink.","72":"I come here to have my hair done by the amazing Elizabeth Eisenstein. She's here until March 2016. So get here while she's cheap!! Not only have I been very impressed with the quality of service I have received from Elizabeth, I am very happy with the instructors involvement to ensure perfection. I have curly hair which I am very particular about and the instructors have been very good at listening to my needs and my concerns as well as understanding how I prefer to style my hair.  I am a fan of this place. I plan on coming back for facials with my mother next month.","73":"Located in the German Village, this Cup o Joe is the best in the chain, in my opinion.  A huge dessert selection and drink menu ensure that there's something for everyone's taste.  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable, and relaxing.  Free WiFi and a location right next to the Book Loft ensure that this place will always be doing business, despite the Starbucks across the street.","74":"Falafel wrap - falafel with greens, pickles, and hummus in  a toasted wrap. I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \n\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.","75":"If this isn't your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you're way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you've never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\n\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \n\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.","76":"Called in flowers over the phone and I was pretty unimpressed with the arrangement they delivered.","77":"If service is any indication, then I'm never going back.  \r\n\r\nWe were basically seated at a table by the host, then told quite rudely by the server that we couldn't sit there.  Then we proceeded to watch as the host and server fought over whether we could sit there or not (while we were trying to scurry away).  Finally we were moved to another server's section, who basically treated us like crap as well.\r\n\r\nI really can't figure out why we stayed?  Cheap beer, I guess.   The food is unremarkable (good wings, though), parking is a pain, and there are so many better places to go.","78":"That was very gratifying!  Sometimes, I just crave a really good burger and fries with a coke.  PDX Sliders delivered without the guilt. Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.","79":"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.","80":"What a gorgeous restaurant ! Three very different rooms to dine from three different parts of the world . Wow I am impressed, the food was amazing . Animal kingdom is just getting better and better by adding this gem. Avatar (pandora ) is set to open in May, can't wait!","81":"I have been going to \"Awesome Tan\" since I moved to Brookline in 1998 It has been 16 years and I love the place They have always take an excellent care of me and they make me feel special when I'm there There are even a couple of the same girls who've worked there since the day I started going I think that says a lot about the owners and the coworker relationships The girls are always very polite and they will take care of all your needs The place is very clean and the prices are reasonable My favorite part is Maria's gorgeous flower arrangements.","82":"Snap is my go-to lunch spot nearly every day! The variety is endless and they are constantly adding new menu items. The Snap team is super friendly and helpful. Almost every time I ask them how a certain item is that I haven't tried yet, they offer to buy it for me so I can try it risk-free. Their food is fresh, delicious, healthy, and easy. What more can you ask for!? Snap for President.\nTip: Anytime I eat these at home (instead of work) I heat them up in a skillet on the stovetop. It's tasty, microwave-free AND it feels home-cooked. :)","83":"Jacks is the place to be. \nThe food is exceptional, I recommend the calzones! Or one of their funky pizza slice creations (hotdog pizza ect)! They have some good alcohol prices and a good atmosphere. During dinner it's always packed though so be prepared to sit out back!","84":"By no means is me giving Habaneros 3 stars a bad thing. This is my go to spot for Mexican food when my family comes to visit me from NY. It's cheap, it's quick and it's surprisingly good. The establishment offers a wide selection of Mexican dinners and combination specials, common in other traditional Mexican restaurants. If you're a fan of Mexican food, especially if you're from out of town just go here and eat. Parking isn't bad, your seated immediately and there is always a table available. Unfortunately there can sometimes be minor communication errors with your waitresses and the staff so make sure to be very clear with what you want when placing your Oder. The food is good, nothing amazing but it definitely hits the spot.","85":"A few months back i went in for a toothache and ended up needing a root canal after diagnosis from Dr. Austria. the front desk then comes to me while I'm still in the chair stating it'll cost $1400 because ive reached the cap on my insurance. i told them i couldn't afford it, they then purpose a payment plan im thinking wow they really want to help me. Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the  treatment. But after looking around more and\nafter talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum.\nBethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating \"we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal\" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! \nBefore doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don't me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they'll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs.","86":"This restaurant is delicious! I've had Ethiopian in DC (which is the best I've tried) but this place is a close runner up.\n\nThe boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We first got the honey wine which was really sweet and syrupy. It reminded me of mead. Then we got the meat combo and everything was tender, delicious and flavorful. They certainly don't skip on the injera here. \n\nMy favorite part about this place specifically is that they serve the food traditional style in colorful baskets! I've never seen that before and it made the experience that much better :)","87":"My favorite hangout, great music, unpretentious cool people and cheep PBR. Besides the concerts, The most fun nights are \"Heroes\"(80ies Party) and \"xMortis\"(Goth)","88":"Joey is the best and my cut grows out evenly and each day is like a new style.\n\nHighly recommend him!","89":"Might be helpful if you were looking to buy, but if you need help with something you currently have then good luck getting any help or response.  I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.  It's obvious the workers don't want to be there.  Stay away from this store and Sprint","90":"This Chicken Express has been doing it right for years now. I've never had a problem, the service is always top notch, and the place is always squeaky clean - dining area, exterior, bathrooms, even the kitchen appears much cleaner than other fast food place from what I can see. I love their fried chicken liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don't have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times. Even if it's just one order of 6 chicken livers, they are happy to cook them up fresh so they are ready when I arrive. Now THAT is exceptional customer service. Thanks Chicken E!","91":"Something about this place made me feel like a smart, cool, hip, 30 something as soon as I walked in the door. The ambiance is dark and inviting at the same time. The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \n\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr\u0413\u00a9e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \n\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.","92":"Nice staff. Subpar food for the price.","93":"Unbelievably rude hostess \nNo respect to customers. \nServer, Dani was the only reason for us to stay... The level of unprofessionalism and unpleasant look that the two hostesses gave are just horrible. I have never experienced this low level of customer service...","94":"I was in Austin recently and searched for a place to eat on this fine website called Yelp. We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\n\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\n\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here. I will make it a point to come back the next time I'm in town.","95":"I used to love this place.  The food is very good, and thankfully that hasn't changed.  However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \n\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it.","96":"My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving.\n\nThe service was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.\n\nI would never eat here again.","97":"Will not be back!!! The service was just awful. We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it. However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1\/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!","98":"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\n\nDecor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.","99":"Good may have been good if my server Megan T actually used a pad and took people's orders instead of guessing and just putting whatever she thought you wanted in front of you. Manager offered discounts because everyone else in my party ate but me, and still charged me for bad food. Stay away. Place next door (Hennessy's) had great food and specials. Thanks for charging me for food I didn't eat and trying to pacify me with discounts you never applied. Boo.....boo......on the right side theTV's are in good spots to watches you eat.....well try to eat","100":"We ended up staying here for a trade show, and I shared a gigantic room with my coworker. Service is excellent in the lobby. Smiles on their faces like they really want to be there. They were dressed nicely and showed us where the restroom was and the plugs at the table in case we had to wait for someone. Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \n\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor's bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \n\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \"shoot pool\" time.) The pool was also pretty nice, but when we stayed, it was pretty cold to be swimming. \n\nI would love to come back and hope to organize a squad trip for my Potterhead friends. It was super nice and not far from the places to see.","101":"Came here for a friends birthday and was impressed! The service was wonderful! Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the chef even came over and said hi. I ordered the duck, it was delicious, very flavorful! The only complaint I had was that it was just duck, no side. Although it was good it was a little weird to eat just duck for dinner.","102":"I've been to this location twice and couldn't be more disappointed. I looked through my provider list and saw this dermatologist listed so I called up for an appointment. When I arrived, I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney. Not the doctor, but the physician's assistant. Huh. Ok. Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor...\n\nStephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. \n\nTook several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time). And it's not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay. I literally sat down, said nope no changes, and got a new prescription.\n\nTime to find a new dermatologist.","103":"I ate here recently on the recommendations of some Muslim brothers at the Islamic Society of Boston (beautiful masjid). They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station.\n\nWe enjoyed the chicken kabob and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch. InshaAllah my wife and I will return soon.","104":"This place is only worth your time if you are looking for discount designer jeans. My advice to anyone selling anything- try eBay or even donate. If this store actually does accept your used clothes\/purses (which is an obstacle in itself, unless you have the style of a 13 year old) they really don't offer a lot. I find that I get more pleasure out of donating my old clothes to a worthy cause. Also- if you do dare to try to sell something to them, give yourself an afternoon because they are highly unorganized and very slow.","105":"Soooo good!  Amazing biscuits, awesome jelly and perfect for a quick breakfast. I'll try the donuts next time. The biscuits are large, thick and not too salty. Up there on the best biscuit list in Austin.","106":"So I tried calling multiple times because the parking deck says 30 min free while the website says 1 hour. Finally someone picks up but he was unable to answer my question to why the difference for prices. He proceeded to tell me to hang on and then hangs up. So I just go inside and the manager says they give us a voucher for the free hour. \nThe waiter was not very attentive. He didn't check on us much. The service at the Johns Creek location is much better. However, I will say the drinks were great and very strong","107":"Great place... delicious tapas and very nice wine list... I didnt try any of the specialty cocktails but I'll in my next visit!","108":"I have been taking aerial classes at Aircraft for about a year, and it is my favorite thing I have ever done (and I've done a lot!). NOTHING takes priority over my aerial class, (seriously, just ask my husband). I look forward to it every single week. The instructors are fantastic, supportive, funny, positive, motivating, and excellent at explaining the various skills. I gained strength very quickly, even going just once a week, but the biggest benefit I have found is that my 75-minute class is the ONLY time in my entire week that I can honestly say my mind is 100% in the present moment. When I'm at aerial practice I don't think about anything else in my life except exactly what I'm doing. I'm concentrating, getting a workout and laughing so hard every single class. It is the best therapy out there, I swear. The groups in each class are small enough to get lots of individual attention from the instructors, so you learn something new every time, and we all support and encourage one another as we're attempting new, challenging skills. I can't say enough positive things about this place...you just HAVE to try it!","109":"This is my new spot for a good burger.\n\nDrew and I visited this restaurant on Friday, July 11th.  \n\nInitially, we went there to get a special milkshake.  They serve shakes with a little alcohol.  Yes, a little alcohol.\n\nThe decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  \n\nDrew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.\n\nThe Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.\n\nThe Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.\n\nThe onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland.\n\nThey had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don't Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. \n\nOverall, I'll be back and would recommend this restaurant.","110":"I am in Atlanta on business, and one of my coworkers said he knows someone who owns an Italian joint, so this is where we ended up.\nI had no expectations whatsoever. Never heard of the place, never even been in the area before.\nYes, the food was somewhat pricey. Everything we had was great. And for the decor, some say tacky, but this is part of what makes this place special.\nI stepped outside with my coffee to catch a quick smoke, and when I re-entered the restaurant, there was fog, colored lights, a variety of hats came off the walls onto children's heads,and some faster faced music was pumping. Again, this is what makes this restaurant unique. \nAll in all, I liked this place. Has some character and if I visit the area again with a craving for Italian, I will try to revisit.","111":"We were seated immediately but unfortunately in the front booth in the bar. I am sure others may find this a good spot but we did not. It was so loud from the children in the waiting area,  the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation  (including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. \nThe food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don't regularly go to the OG and don't expect too much, they didn't improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills.  On all dishes there was very little sauce.  The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed (red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce.","112":"This place really hits the spot after a long day of shopping on Newbury st.  I finally get to sit down after walking for hours, eat some good sushi , drink some good miso soup and re-energize for more shopping.\n\nEven though the sushi men at this place can be a little creepy, I love this place and it will forever be my lunch spot when i'm shopping in the area\n\nxo\nAlena","113":"I just had a terrible experience here at the Shaking Crab in Quincy.  The server brought us our crab and told us that the crackers were in the washer and would be out in a minute or two. Then 10 minutes passed, still no utensils, we asked again and a different server told us that they didn't have any more, that they kept going missing. This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table.  We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.  I would give them a negative star if I could. The food was NOT worth the money it cost us.","114":"Realize this is a small cafe local\nhang out.  But wow the food was a big surprise. Lots of flavor and tons of quality and great value to boot. Everything is made from scratch. Simple awesome and a place I will run back to.","115":"We've been big fans of Occidental and Urban German and couldn't wait for this to open. It didn't disappoint! The schnitzel was amazing and we can't wait to go back for the sp\u0413\u00a4tzle...it was already sold out! Bridge views make this place over the top! So glad this is in St Johns and can't wait to go back!","116":"All 5 of these stars are for my friend Bobby. He showed excellent customer service and executed his job flawlessly. He also seemed to be an honest guy. Not just jiffy lube, but the world needs more people like Bobby. Thanks for helping me out with my tires man","117":"Stopped in for lunch, was pleasantly surprised! We ordered garlic cheese bread, the pizza lovers flatbread and chicken piccata. All were very delicious. The service was great, the food was great, the music makes you feel like you are in Italy. We will be back for sure!","118":"We asked them about adding the gooey half boiled eggs that you'd be able to get at any other ramen place - and they only serve hard boiled eggs! This just seemed extremely weird to us and as owners of a ramen shop I would highly recommend they add that to their menu. Sorry but it's a necessity. As for our meals, they were unremarkable. Extremely bland and I honestly regret wasting time, money, and calories.","119":"The cost isn't expensive and it is very good. For me, places like Voodoo is too sweet for me, but it is not the case for Donut Palace. The donut itself is very airy and absolutely delicious when bitten down. I have only been there once, but I'm already enjoying it a lot!","120":"Worst food ever ... It was my wife's birthday and we were in Orlando celebrating by going to bunch of theme parks ... She is so fond of indo Chinese cuisine , so I really wanted to eat out ... Pulled out yelp and saw this place advertised so .... It was the most disappointing experiance ..\n\nThat f'ing place does not even know what is indo Chinese , they even justified it is indo Chinese .... Pls avoid this place ....the server was an a'Hole who was suggesting all crap ...","121":"I dined at this restaurant before the most recent owner took over and the prices were never as high as they are now therefore I have not dined there until this past weekend, 3\/16\/13.\n\nWent with a group of friends and although the food we ordered tasted fine, the price just does not justify it.  They're making a killing on food profit.\n\nMy husband and I shared the pick two cold appetizers (we chose babaganoush and hummus).  It came out on a small saucer and contained maybe a 1\/2 c of each for $10.75.  I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $5 for the lavas bread (what was I suppose to eat with the dips).  Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.\n\nI know I will not come back to eat here.  I can find the same type of food that taste just as great and pay the price that it should be.","122":"The dishes were executed flawlessly and they were presented beautifully. Minus a star for the seemingly rushed service. Our server breezed through the description of the dishes. \n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience. (Had the 14 course meal with pairing.)","123":"Never in years of Legal Seafood dedication have I had a bad meal here, EVER. A crab roll comes on a buttered & grilled roll so light it's almost ethereal. Really it's an amazing roll and just amplifies the quality of the crabmeat. \n\nThe salads are terrific but the best part might be the servers. Warm, attentive and helpful, just trust me- you'll eat here every chance you get!","124":"Went here on Sunday for first time. Plenty of parking which was nice. The jalapeno cornbread was very good! Mac n chz also good. Ordered the moist brisket because I thought it would be better since the lean is generally dry at times..the brisket was super moist, fatty, and very greasy..had alot of oil on the plate..most of what I got was fat...next time ill try the lean..the sausage was so so..im still a bigger fan of pokejoes..\n\nThere was a guy who looked homeless playing guitar and singing very loud inside..went to sit outside in the heat bc this guy was so loud and annoying..he seemed kinda drunk too..not sure why they let him do this bc ruined the atmosphere for us..\n\nI'll give it another shot but it is pricey and wasn't that great","125":"Still an exceptional restaurant with several new menu items including a gimmicky (and tasty) \"sorta-Asian\" fried chicken and waffles.  I'm a spicy food fan with a fire resistant pallete, but the hot sauce with the otherwise-excellent chicken wings was WAY over applied and actually ruined my whole dinner.  Service has gotten slow, forgetful and a little too cool for school (second time we've noticed this...).","126":"Love this place! Their food and drink menus are both very creative, which is perfect for me. \n\nThe Pumpkin Martini is delicious (ask for it with a cinnamon sugar rim). The Keylime Pie Martini is also amazing. They have a lengthy beer list as well.\n\nAs far as food is concerned, the mac and cheese is scrumtrulescent (half portion is definitely sufficient). Also, the Rialto is lovely, and the bread pudding is heaven (generous portion, good to share).\n\nThe service is generally phenomenal. The waitresses are really sweet and easy going, which makes the experience that much better. I've only experienced poor service here once. The girl had a pissy attitude and was simply unpleasant, but don't let that detour you from going to Parish; I'd give it 10 stars if that was an option.","127":"Here's a breakdown of what my boyfriend and I spent in about an hour:\n2 entries for $20 total - this got us a ride up the elevator\n3 drinks $22 total - this was pretty reasonable and the pours were generous \n2 putt putt golf games for $20 total - this is outrageous for sub-par (pun intended) course\n1 $5 game card - this got us two games of SKEE BALL (are you kidding me? I'll go to ormsby's and pay a quarter next time. \n\nTotal - $67 in about an hour in a half. No thanks. \n\nI'm sure they are trying to recoup their investment quickly but unless they lower prices, I will chalk this up to a one-time visit.","128":"HOB Boston. What can i say.\nThough it is part of a chain, i really couldn't quite feel the typical HOB vibe.\nThe food was average and uneventful. \nThe semi private concert i attended was great and that raised the star level to 2.\nThey could use some more people who enjoy working there. I couldn't feel the pride nor the funny bone that usually is part of the HOB team.\nI know there is room for improvement and i know the management has the costumers satisfaction as a priority.  That is why i am sure that they will make it their mission to review all the constructive criticism and make the proper adjustments.","129":"Wow. Thank you, Yelp.\nI am SO glad I found this place tonight. It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston\/Allston area.\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \n\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\n\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.","130":"Been here a few times.  One of the better individual hotpot places around the lower mainland. Portions are good. Price is decent considering you are cooking your own food. I always leave full. Light years better then firepot in burnaby. Definitely a try if you like hotpot","131":"This place is just plain great. Food is great and very unique. Service is impeccable. The Vodka cocktail is a must try if you like vodka. I ended  my dining experience with a chocolate pudding...I am in heaven. If you are in the area please do not miss this place. Cheers!!!","132":"My friend and I came to Austin in July. We both needed a little pampering and boy did we get it! Wonderful spa and a great massage! I can't wait to go back and visit again!","133":"Nice music, excellent service, reasonable prices. The staff is super friendly and food is delicious and fairly priced. Potstickers and Mac and cheese were amazing. The bacon jam burger is my favorite. I love this place. You should go!","134":"This is the best place specially during summer evenings . They do provide outer dining area , which is really beautiful . Staff is very friendly .food and drinks are good","135":"So we sat at the bar after a 45 minute wait. Excited to try what I remember to be great coffee, I ordered my food and a Lavender Mocha. We watched as they prepared our coffee. When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.","136":"What a quaint little authentic Argentinan restaurant.  Located east of Downtown Austin, but close enough to downtown.  They had delicious meat and spinach empandas.  All types of Argentinan wines to choose from as well to encompass the flavors of South America.  We ordered the pork tenderloin for dinner and  the gnocchi.  I LOVED the gnocchi! I thought it was so good! For dessert we had the chocolate creme brulee.  It was delicious too!","137":"Had a few delicious things here: Arroz con Camarones (Shrimp Rice), Tostones, Maduros, Bistec Merengue. Also the Queso y Salami Frito app was perfect. As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. \n\nA few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.\n\nThe drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.","138":"Wow!!! Absolutely the BEST donuts I've EVER had!!! Tried old fashion glazed, Mexican hot chocolate (favorite!!!) & apple fritters...and no kidding...BEST EVER!!! Dense, moist & DEEEEE-lightful!!! A must if you're in the area!!! Yummmmmmm!!!","139":"The wireless is spotty to the point of being useless.  It was very difficult to even get this review posted, much less do a meaningful work-related task using the internet.  I do not recommend staying here if you depend on a reliable internet connection.  Staff state it is a free service so it should not matter if it works or does not work, and there will be no further effort to fix this ongoing issue.\n\nThe quality of the food for breakfast was slightly below that of a school cafeteria.  The waiter was surprisingly inattentive given that there was only one other table to serve (at minimum I expect a single glass of water).\n\nIt takes about 3-5 minutes to enter the room due to the quirky key card system; one must insert and remove the card timed perfectly or the lock faults and the process need to be retried.\n\nIn spite of the above, the beds were comfortable.","140":"We ate at this place all three mornings we were in Orlando this past weekend. The food was awesome and the servings were large! The first and third day we had breakfast there the service was so amazing! The two different ladies were very attentive and super friendly. The second day (different lady) was not as great but she was busy and alone so I will give her that. The place was very clean and a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended!","141":"On a lark (which is a bird according to wikipedia and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense used in the phrase 'on a lark') we decided to try something different for dinner and went to Cafe Josie.  This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).\n\nThe restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.\n\nWe had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  \n\nI'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.","142":"It was my very first visit  the service was awesome and they assured me that I would love the food. And guess what I definitely  love the food  hands down. It was very clean and also a nice bar you can even set outside for that summer  fun. Try them for yourself. I'll  be a regular ....","143":"Dime a dozen lounge near the Douche Ranch.\n\nMeh.","144":"Great spot. Comfortable little joint smack dab in the middle of Harvard Square. Drop in on a hot day and grab a bubble tea while shootin' the breeze with the staff. You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. \n\nThe only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \n\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. \n\nAlso the staff deserves a shout-out. They can talk about the Rival Mob with the best of them.","145":"I went to do my usual grocery shopping this evening got done collecting my items starting working my way to the registers, once I get close enough I notice there is only 1 register open for all items, 2 registers open for 12 items or less and 3 registers open for self service. My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it. Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register. But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with 3 at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed. I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything. At the end of the day there are several people in this world looking for work and can't find it while we have people like the ones I encountered today with positions they are clearly abusing. This place truly needs a reface of their front workers I can't say the whole store but definitely the front workers.","146":"Best theater ever.  Great seats great service.  You gonna spend some money but it's worth it if your a movie buff.  Got to go","147":"Out if the three burrito places on Huntington by Northeastern, this \"fast food\" is my favorite. They have pretty high quality amazing-tasting food, and always change up their menu so you aren't always ordering a normal burrito. I love the burrito bowls, personally.","148":"Point #1 - Haggle Free?\n\nNow if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated.  I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  \n\nI pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. \n\nInstead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.\n\nConclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.\n\n\nPoint #2 - Prices are insane??\n\nOnce upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\n\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...","149":"This is a place to be in the morning while visiting Portland!\n\nBlue Star donuts have incredible sweets and savory delights to choose from. The donuts here are just mouth watering and glorious to look at while being in line because for one they are moist and not overall sweet for anyone who may be a sweet tooth.\n\nGreat thing to know is that the lines aren't too long which you may have imaged and I have to say its not like Voodoo donuts and that's for sure.","150":"Delicious shirini (sweets) and the best napoleans in the northeast!","151":"If you haven't been to, eaten, or heard of Tiff's Treats you are missing out on the sugary glory of amazingly soft warm as good as homemade cookie amazing ness. I am a long time lover and consumer of Tiff's Treats. This location happens to be closest to my house and my work so it is the most convenient one for me which means it's probably the only one I've been too. \n\nThe negatives: if you're visiting in person, the parking is abysmal. Prepare to walk from the next parking lot over, but after some fatty cookie or brownie deliciousness that may not be the worst thing. I have visited this location on many many occasions and I have never seen one employee behind the counter waiting to great customers. 99% of their business is probably delivery but every time they are in the back talking completely unaware that you have walked in and can hear them.\n\nThe positives: The chocolate chip, the sugar, and the snickerdoodle obviously! Outside of their very few and easily fixed negatives, Tiff's Treats cannot be beat when it comes to warm cookies on demand. They even have milk and ice cream to go with it if you so desire.","152":"To say that I am in love with Thaitation is...quite possibly an understatement.  I have always loved Thai food and was a fan of Brown Sugar while in college.  When I moved to Fenway and heard that Thaitation was related to Brown Sugar..I was skeptical.  Brown Sugar, in my opinon, had fallen a bit so I was not sure how great Thaitation would be.\n\nI was wrong.  Thaitation is just delicious.  Brown Sugar is no longer a place in my go to restaurants and I have convinced all of my college friends that it is no longer worth the trip and Thaitation is the place to be!\n\nPad thai, broccoli with tofu and mushrooms, wonton soup, mango curry...I could go on for days!  I also love that I can usually get two meals out of an entree so the prices don't seem too steep.\n\nGreat Quality, Quantity...what more could you ask for?!","153":"I loved the tuna tacos...deep fried rolled in corn tortilla..mmmmmmmm. Great with guac. And the migas were so yummy! My daughter always loves the breakfast tacos. On special occasions, I will get the chicken with mole sauce. SOOO good!!! Salsa is good too, fresh ingredients. I love all the fresh fruit drinks (frescas). My favorite is the white one (rice drink)...probably the worst for me.\n\nGreat service, always friendly. I don't mind the cheap prices either. I love the atmosphere here, cool and hip. If you're traveling down Congress, find this place!... It's a diamond in the rough!\n\nAustinite now transpotted in FL but make going to Nueva Onda a priority every time I come home to visit.","154":"Visited this restaurant today for their new weekday lunch hour and was immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff and service. However, after my Caesar salad with grilled shrimp ($8 additional) showed up, I was less than impressed. This dish comes with 4 pretty small grilled shrimp, that should really only be worth $4 at most. I even asked the waitress if that was all the shrimp it came with and she confirmed it was. Will not return to this restaurant as I don't feel at all that I got a meal worth what I paid.","155":"I took my husband here last night for his birthday.  When I made the reservation they asked if it was for a special occasion and I told them it was for a birthday.  Everyone who came to our table knew and made sure to wish him a happy birthday.  We ordered the special appetizer which was a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, mussels, and some sort of white fish in a tomato sauce.  He got the skate fish and I ordered the halibut.  Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  \n\nThe reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the fish selection as well as the wine.  They even gave us pistachio ice cream, baklava, and homemade donuts as a birthday dessert.","156":"My husband and I tried to get in before they were open and the chef jumped out of the car to keep us from walking away. He unlocked the door and let us sit in the cool air and truly could not have been more welcoming. The bartender took over and was so friendly and helpful and wasn't even slightly upset to be asked to start early. I'm so glad we stayed. The avocado toast was different and amazing with a great citrus twist and the 106 burger was amazing and huge!  We are excited to\nGo back and try brunch.","157":"The best sushi at Orlando. Excellent service and great ambience to enjoy the food and relax.","158":"Listen....landscapers are a dime a dozen so how do you know whom to trust.? Let James Sierra and Sierra Out Door Living change your mind the way he has changed mine. The usual stuff sure but.......replacement of dead Mexican palm trees, powerwashing, irrigation installation and repair and metal fencing are just a few of the things he is great at. I have even referred him to my Homeowners Association and they report the same as I have described. If you are a property owner or are a property manager give him a try!","159":"This place is pretty cool! The ambiance has more of a nightclub feel. Music playing, an older crowd (wouldn't recommend for families since it was just so loud and dark). We ordered a variety of items and the food was just ok. I was expecting more because of the price point and the location.  The worst was the sushi. I don't think I'll be back. Just not my cup of tea.","160":"My preferred Austin area restaurant.\nQuality food & servce.  Great value. Consider spliting a meail to engae the Gumbo & dessert.\nBest in Austin.  Check hours for lunch & dinner.","161":"I highly recommend TLC Laser for anyone looking into LASIK or PRK surgery. The free consult was informative and trustworthy. Just had my actual procedure yesterday and the whole process from start to finish was seamless. I'm 39 years old and have struggled with contacts and glasses for years and years. I only wish I had opted for Laser much sooner. TLC is definitely a reputable center with a reputable surgeon and trained support staff. The overall cost seems pricey compared to other offers, but well worth the peace of mind and care provided.","162":"I had so much fun walking up and down the aisle's of this store. There was so much variety of products and so many neat (and super cute) things for great prices. I ended up buying way more than I needed, but it was so worth the price and I can't wait to come back here!!!","163":"My first day. Had a hungry three year old. Ate in the lobby. They forgot our order. We waited over an hour. What a painful memory. This was right off the plane. Meal comped but that doesn't take it away. Hope that they aren't like this to others. Not like they were nasty or malicious. And the shuttle? Great but not great if you are leaving late. If you leave first thing in the morning it's good. Otherwise great hotel very well maintained.","164":"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!","165":"Cheap glass without being a pain in the ass... Great service!!!! Hope I don't need another windshield any time soon- but if I did I would go right back to these guys!","166":"Eating healthy I had the turkey burger it was great. No fries and water w lemon. #JackLimeTeam had a great time. #Anchorman2","167":"I'm less than impressed with Sweet. Like several others, I also found them a tad sweet for my taste, although not unbearably so. More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I've had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry.\n\nIt was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry. I've never put a cupcake down before without finishing it, but for the first time I did. \n\nThis is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting. These bakers could learn a lot from the cupcake shops in DC and New York.","168":"Channing is a photo ninja.\n\nMy parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.","169":"STUDY THIS STORE PICTURE CLOSELY SOUTHERN WEST COASTERS! Why the hell we dont have stores like these is totally beyond me. They have giant floor scales that are zeroed out to the weight of a cart and then you just kinda go from the price per pound list. Never in my life have i been anywhere where clothing leather and basically anything material for your home was sold in such huge quantity.  Theyve got it all and ya its in different price ranges (glass 59 cents a pound, cloth 20 (DATED so dont take my word for it) but who gives a rats? This place is awesome. nuff said.","170":"Super fan of this spot in downtown! Came out for a lunch meeting and was surprised at how good it truly was.  Ordered the Lamb Gyro platter with side of Hummus and Babaghanoush. Platter has a good portion of lamb on top of a small amount of rice... served with pita and pita chips. \n\nGreat Lunch spot. My new fav Mediterranean food place in Orlando!","171":"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.","172":"Really tasty and very fresh food. We ordered a salad, a gyro, hummus and baklava and everything was delicious and really fresh. Only subtracted one star because they need a water filter on their drinks. They all have a funky taste. I will def be back often and just buy the Mexican cokes to go with.","173":"This place is good! You have to stop and try if your in Austin. I had the Raspberry white chocolate shake and a burger. Best burger place in Austin.","174":"Neil England is a true \"Ink God\". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....\n\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \n\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\n\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\n\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\n\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it's the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....","175":"This virtual ride takes you on a scenic and sensory tour of Canada. It's a beautiful place and I can't imagine the countless hours spent putting the videos together through real flight time. That being said it is absolutely not worth the money. Unless you can't make it anywhere else in Vancouver I would skip this and visit some of the actual land, air and sea tours around Vancouver. The ride last about 5 minutes (or less) it took more time to watch the intro video (called rise or uplift or something like that )\nand the safety video. \nIt was just an ok experience but I had an amazing time otherwise in Vancouver and the surrounding areas.","176":"A violent vomiting session, cold sweats, and a general blue-ish white skin color had us changing our plans from heading to the airport to heading to the nearest urgent care facility. All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. \n\nWhen we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. \n\nWe left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights. \n\nThanks, team! Hopefully we'll never need to see you again, but if we get sick on the way to the airport again, we know where to go!","177":"Great photo op if you ever find yourself in the city of Austin Texas.  Upon googling things to visit in Austin,  this spot always popped up which sparked my curiosity.\n\nDont expect anything fancy though when you come.  This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to.  Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history.  I was advised by the locals here that this place may no longer be here in the near future.  Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments.\n\nI love that there are no frills here.  If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt,  climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves.  Just do it, its worth it.  I wish i did.  But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie.\n\nI would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top.  Hopefully its still there at that time.","178":"Now, I have written on the subject of shabu shabu before- and there is not question that it is my personal favorite and Kaze Shabu Shabu is and always will be the tastiest and best quality hot pot that I have ever had- but Hot Pot Buffet is a really great way for hot pot newbies to experience a wide rang of ingredients for one low price.  You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. \n\nWe had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.  I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time.\n\nWe had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs- we got two orders!!  \n\nReally you can't go wrong here- unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in.  But you get used to it!  For $20.00 this is about the best deal in China Town.","179":"For electricity bill mishap: It might be National Grid or fire department's mistake but we were renting the apt from Riversedge and it was property manager's responsibility to inform us rather than pushing us away and acting ignorant.\n\nI agree you can charge us for repairing the wall if it was mentioned in the lease - which was not. Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be \"nail size\" or we will be charged for the repair. As a matter of fact, lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts - do nails need toggle bolts?\n\nThese costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before it's not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand. No one like such surprises.\n\nThanks for offering to reimburse but not needed. Its the inconvenience.....\n\nLastly, As I mentioned in my previous post - Its a nice apartment but not proper support from staff.","180":"Great atmosphere and packaging... but the cupcake tasted really bad and the frosting even worse!\n\nI was very excited to try Sweet after it opened and the very cute atmosphere gave me hope that I would be in for a treat.  I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging.  However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed.  The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1\/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  \nI think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!  You have to have cupcakes that actually taste good... or at least are not objectionably bad!  I am not sure how they are going to make it... I hope for their sake they figure out how to actually make a product that people will enjoy eating!","181":"Visiting Atlanta for a conference and I needed a bit of respite so I searched for my favorite comfort food, pho. I was happy to find this place less than a mile from the GWCC.  I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.","182":"We had such an amazing experience with Hillarry!  She photographed our baby Maxwell from newborn to 1 year and we love all of our pictures!  She is so easy to work with and is very creative with everything she does.  I can't say enough great things about her:)  We will definitely be using Hillarry again when we have another little one.","183":"I found this Thai restaurant at yelp! \nSmall, cozy restaurant. Service was good. Food was excellent!! Will visit again.","184":"Blood Orange Creamsicle you guys! Do I need to say anything else? My husband and I tried this place on a whim, we are devout Salt & Straw lovers but we were in the area and were feeling adventurous. We sampled a few flavors and I immediately settled on the blood orange creamsicle, it was a little tart with all the creamy dreamy goodness you want in a creamsicle. My husband got a hot fudge sundae. The sundae was a little unorthodox, chock full of crunchy and dark cocoa nibs, but he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nA couple weeks later my friends were visiting and I knew one of them would just die for the blood orange creamsicle. We happened to find ourselves in the neighborhood so we stopped. 3 scoops of creamsicle later and we were all happy campers. \n\nPro-tip they also have a mini scoop, in case you want to indulge, but not too much!\n\nThe point? Order the blood orange creamsicle you guys!","185":"Excellent subs at a reasonable price. A huge variety too for those picky eaters that can't decide on what to settle for. Come with an empty stomach and enjoy a great turkey and ranch or one of their other 100 subs!","186":"We have stayed here the last 4 years for a event in Disney and it has been great ! \n\nThe furnishings are lovely and the design very different ! The service has been very good . My only complaint is the restaurant upstairs in the lobby \"Blu\" is overpriced . We could not get a reservation till quite late , but we ate  down at the Tesoro cove and it was excellent . Farm to table... fresh pasta all the salad you can eat was very reasonable . Breakfast there was excellent also . We had a wonderful visit !","187":"Amazing. \n\nTasty food, good waiter recommendations, good service, fair prices.  If you're in JP and craving Indian - come here. Or if you're in Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville...jump on the 39 and get over here. \n\nGet the chicken curry.  Another recommendation is the duck on the chef's special list.","188":"The food has always been good, always. The service on he other hand has always always been bad. The waiters always leave you hanging, the owner is rude and, sad to say, ghetto in front of customers. Again, the food is spot on but the service is horrible. I have been coming here for years and it never changes. We are here today, the first time in a couple months and they have renovated. They have expanded into the unit next door. Good renovation, bigger space, better decor. Still a ways to go before it is finished but good. Wish the service was better, unfortunately I doubt I will return. I think today was it.","189":"Meh. Average Thai food at above average prices. The menu offers nothing  new or creative. Just the standard Thai fare. Prices are easily 50-100% higher than better quality food from restaurants in Woburn and Lowell. Next time I will drive an extra 5 minutes.","190":"If you have driven past this place several times, you have missed a great opportunity for Costa Rican food those same several times. The food is good, fresh, and it feels homemade. Check it out, and make sure to try things that are from Costa Rica, not just your comfortable Mexican fare. Family-run, small location, super tasty.","191":"First time here the staff was wonderful and the food was very well prepared and tasty. I am very particular about Italian restaurants and this one is very good. We will be back often I am sure. The only problem I see is they might need more room very quickly","192":"Always look forward to getting my teeth cleaned, Jerri is a hoot!!!!!! the dental office is really starting to shape up. everyone is so pleasant to talk to. Dr. Daby you have something special going on at your practice!","193":"The Barking Crab was a family tradition for us for years before I moved to Boston. Once a summer, when visiting our family in the city, we would go to the Barking Crab for some decent food and wonderful atmosphere. Sadly, once I became vegetarian, the menu became extremely limited for me, which made it much less appealing. But still, many happy memories from the Barking Crab! Great family place!","194":"Meatloaf was very good ....I had a very good meal here. Staff was very friendly as well. Place was quiet and was very relaxing. Prices are fair. Something for everyone on the menu and breakfast all day. I'll be back.","195":"This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before. \n\nRegarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.","196":"I went here this past weekend for their roast (first Saturday of every month). The food was wonderful.  The atmosphere was great.  Beers and cocktails were yummy!  The menu was interesting....\n\nBUT - the portion was small.  It was a ham roast with mashed sweet potatoes, turnips and brussel sprouts.  The meal had about a 1\/4 cup of sweet mashed potatoes and 2 1\/2 brussel sprouts.  I was there with 8 people and I don't think anyone left satisfied.\n\nI'll give it another try - but it was not a good first impression.","197":"It honestly takes them forever to bring food after you've ordered it. It really doesn't even matter if they're busy or not nor does it matter what you order it will be a long time before they bring it. I must admit other than that it's a cool dive bar.","198":"I LOVE THE WOLF.\n\nI have been living in Salem for four years and this place and 62 on the Wharf are my two favorites by FAR. I work in the restaurant scene in Boston and frequently dine at excellent places, but I keep coming back to the Wolf for my casual night out. \n\nQuest is MAGIC\n\nHowling Wolf Burrito - why do i EVER let myself get anything else??? ( because I want to try everything, that's why). It's just SO perfect. Try it. Just do it. You'll die. \n\nI also love the chorizo papusa appetizer. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. \n\nService is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times (one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower-than-desired experience. \n\nAfter I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends.","199":"I would definitely stay here again. \n\nSome of the reviews are a bit harsh.. and I'm not sure why. If you're a hotel\/motel snob, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! \n\nThe property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)","200":"I've always liked Flip (I've been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. \n\nThis past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?","201":"Just had a shellac mani\/pedi. I'm usually pretty fair in the sense that I expect to get what I pay for. And since this is one of the lower-priced nail salons in the area, I didn't come in with extremely high expectations. But even with my modest expectations, I was seriously disappointed with this place. The tools used for my pedicure and manicure looked overused and unsanitary, the women in the salon carried on a conversation at the top of their lungs the entire time I was there, and my nails were unevenly shaped. I will definitely be finding another salon in the area.","202":"Sooooo happy we found this place. I have been wanting to go for awhile but Husband (never having had tapas) was resistant (although he loves seafood, rice and ham - go figure!). Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (\"like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!\"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.\nCannot wait to go back!\nPros: everything\nCons: need more friends so we can order more variety :)","203":"Hard to find good interior Mexican food around here. I had the pescado yucatano. So delicious. Everyone else enjoyed their tex mex. Reasonable prices, too!","204":"Super fun bar with great beer and a lively atmosphere. I went on a Friday night with friends and saw multiple live music performances. We had to wait in line for a little while but the man at the front made it go by quicker by asking us trivia questions. There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn't have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I've had better. I really liked their 'bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch. Some things I didn't take advantage of was the chocolate bar, the arcade games, or the tasting room restaurant in the back, but definitely things I want to try next time I'm there!","205":"Top notch service! Very attentive and anticipated all our needs. We had the recommended lava bread with babaganoush (to die for!) for an appetizer and then the recommended mixed platter for two for $35. We got a side of cucumber\/garlic tzatziki and the savory iskander tomato sauce. Simply amazing and still leftovers! You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee (watch out for the 1\/4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For the chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut baklava is delectable and rich. The best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic!","206":"A good place for a break from the dining hall fare I usually deal with @ Wellesley.... I prefer Cambridge One for the same feel - gourmet pizzas and salads. It is a nice casual dinner - in addition, it is one of the few places in Wellesley (a dry town) that has a license to serve mixed drinks and they are good. \n\nThe spicy chicken sausage pizza or blanco is the way to go.","207":"The food was good and the service was exceptional.  There were a couple of snafus - my soup was taken to the wrong table - which the wait staff made up for with cups of another soup to tide me over.  Staff was also very sensitive to my food allergies, and made sure there was no cross contamination in the kitchen. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how well children are accommodated.  There's a dedicated child's menu with low cost (around $5) entrees, and crayons for coloring.  (The kids' food was great, too.)","208":"I'm going up update my review to 5 stars.  The restaurant has updated the menu and it is the best of both worlds- more like the old Castle Hill with a lot of the new favorites still on the menu.  The service is excellent with experienced professional servers.  The food is always consistent.","209":"Had a amazing dinner. Price was on point nothing over the top. Food quality was great. Only thing was they were so busy that service was hard but still wasn't to a point that is bad. The lobster was yummy and so was the sides.","210":"I shall give 3.5 stars. The dining environment is great and you can tell how food is cooked by sitting on the bar seats. The food is nice but a little salty. Other is good.","211":"We went there for restaurant week and had an amazing experience. The service was among the best I've ever experienced and the food was also incredible. They were able to accommodate many allergies and food preferences at my table without any problems.","212":"The Jajangmyeon noodles entree is decent. The service is poor. I will not be returning.","213":"This is my new cleaner. My old cleaner started out with one day turn around, then it became three, they lost things and ruined things.\n\nI found this new cleaner through Yelp friends. \n\nThey are fast, polite. They have coupons discount for first second and third time customers through their website. (though the website part through Qwest has been flaky) \n\nThey continue to delight me with their service: \"Do you have a substitute for the plastic bags covering the newly cleaned clothes?\" (they do). \"I lost some __, do you know where I can buy some in town?\" \"We have them, how many do you need?\" All above and beyond!\n\nThe traffic flow in the area is tricky, suggest approaching them from Broadway and PSU.\n\nGood service!","214":"Went there last night and was disappointed again!  How hard is it to take and order and fill it?  All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived.  At least they didn't put it on the bill this time.   I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.  And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent.  Not a good showing last night.  It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.   Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service?  That's a tough sell.","215":"Finally, a non-threatening and reasonably priced Brazilian BBQ!\n\nYou have two options here: all-you-can-eat for $12 and change or pay by the pound.  The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.\n\nNow, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.\n\nThe fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  \n\nBe sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.\n\nA special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.\n\nThere's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.\n\nThe value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience.  I will definitely be back.","216":"The worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to in vancouver.\nThe the shreaded pork had no mushrooms and is full of Msg.\nThe lions head was full of corn starch.\nThe fish was not fresh.\nWe have to wait 40 minutes for dessert which we eventually cancelled thee order.\nYou can be blind folded and bump into a better Chinese restaurant in Vancouver.\nService was slow with an attitude.  The chef managed to screw up every dish we ordered. I was angry and said I would write them up on yelp. The response is their loyal chinese customers do not use yelp. wt$%&++","217":"I mostly eat here at lunch, for the tremendous buffet. I don't have another benchmark for Tibetan cuisine so my raking is based on the comparison to the other lunch staple in Central Square: the ubiquitous Indian buffets. I admit to a fanatical love of cilantro and it is featured in many of the dishes.\nThe dumplings are my fav(Tsel Momo, Langsha Momo), and I always start with those. I also like the noodle dishes(Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp(Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef(Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork(Phaksha Solo) and chicken(Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too. If you like nan try the breads.","218":"This place is amazing. From the staff, to the food, and the decor. Went during lunch and the food options are amazing. The bakery goods look so delicious. Order the artichoke eggs Benedict. Every bite was worth it. The wait staff is great. Very helpful and friendly. Worth the stop.","219":"Precision Moving Company did an amazing job moving our belongings from Brookline to Cambridge last week. Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way. They cleaned everything out in record time, and were flexible when we uncovered and threw some extra stuff at them at the last minute. The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved. They obviously take pride in their work and we'll never use a different moving company again!","220":"The staff is amazingly attentive and maybe just a bit overbearing. They earn commission so be prepared to be treated like royalty. Every staff member seem to know the people walking in, and remembers what colors they like, what type of shoes they prefer...etc. \n\nThe quality of Ferragamo is top-notch, paired with elegant design in handbags to shoes (super comfortable). The quality is certainly reflected in the price. Though I don't shop here often, I always feel like I'm in Handbag-Heaven when I walk in! \n\nI wish Toronto had their own Ferragamo boutique shop, instead of just the varieties available at Holts. So, this place is a must visit when visiting Vancouver!","221":"Went here with my family and friends (4 adults 2 young children). The hostess and waiter were incredibly accommodating and kind to us. The service was fantastic and the  food was delicious and fresh! We all had a special pesto linguini with seafood (lobster, jumbo shrimp, and scallops). It was out of this world!  We will definitely be coming back many times!! Totally recommend if you are looking for great food, great atmosphere, and amazing service!","222":"we really enjoyed our tasty and cozy meal here.  We ordered three small plates: yak momo, calamari and green beans. All were lovely, and there was quite a bit left over for two of us. I also especially appreciate the very reasonable glasses of wine to enjoy along with the food.  Ambiance is cozy, quiet.  A great date night and some tasty treats (for those not familiar with Himalayan food, there is a bit of something for everyone, curries and things that sounds like what you might find at Indian restaurants, to other things that are quiet apart). We didnt try the green papaya salad on the menu but that also sounded yummy","223":"JEREMY ROCKS!!\nI am completely bowled over that this rockin' haircut only cost $12.\nWent to Avenue Five for the first time after reading all these reviews. Had an appt with another stylist, but she was running late so I was put with JEREMY. Thank you, God! He is AMAZING and I'm thrilled to get in on the beginning of what will be his amazing career. He is an ARTIST. I brought pictures in to show him what I was going for, talked about how my thick straight hair lays flat on my head like a dead raccoon in the hot\/humid summer, asked if he could please cut it (and show me how to style it) so that it doesn't do that. He did some amazing techniques (which my previous $90 stylist had never done), and my haircut is AMAZING. He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable. I feel beautiful! Am going to take a picture today to post with this review.","224":"Jerk chicken didn't taste authentic. Chicken  taco had bone in it. Restaurant is in food court of flea market so don't expect atmosphere.","225":"Great comfortable place for wings and a beer. Staff is super friendly and the whole place has a good vibe. All walks of life are welcomed here and fit in seamlessly. Wish this chain existed in Cincy.","226":"My husband and I were referred to Sean by a friend who used him as a realtor a few years ago. Sean really knows the Austin (and surrounding area) market and was able to give us great insight. He is very down to earth and told us his honest opinions, and he is super knowledgeable about what pitfalls to look for and if you need to worry about this or that. He really helped guide us through the process as first time homebuyers. He has great recommendations for Home Inspectors, repair guys, and mortgage lenders if you need it.","227":"\"El Paso Style Food\" huh...when I first saw this place, I thought to myself, hmm, I am originally from El Paso and your telling me you make food like mama did back home? Well, this I have to see.\" I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T\nhe salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican's Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. \nI also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma's food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. \nWhen I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. For all you original El Pasoens in Austin, this place is for you, but sorry they don't serve Chico's Tacos (El Paso humor) lol. I recommend this place for anyone, it is a great place to eat.","228":"Best black 'n bleu cheese burger I ever did have! Cozy too!","229":"I have mixed feelings about this place. First it's really cute and fun. I got excited about the cereal on the donuts since I haven't had Cap'n Crunch since I was 10. But a few things will probably keep me from going back. The server actually left out a donut I asked for and I had to check the box and make sure it was in there so that was kind of lame because she definitely charged me for it.\n\nThe donuts themselves are very thick and yeasty so I could only make it through one before I felt very full. I like to have a variety of donuts and different flavors when I splurge on donuts and it just isn't possible here. \n\nI think I'll probably stick to other places that do the donuts themselves better and aren't just a spectacle.","230":"Excellent view. Nice pub menu. The Cuban was excellent. You order at the bar and are given a buzzer to pick up your food. I like that they serve the food as it's ready, and do not wait for everything to be ready to call you up. The beer menu was extensive, but the tap water tasted funny. Stick with bottled water!","231":"Highlights: Recently revisited BTS -- one of my favorite college hangout spots a few years back. Had an incredibly rude customer service experience. Surprised, disappointed, and won't be returning. Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere. I'm not sure what changed, but on principle I won't be supporting a business that lacks respect for their customers.\n\n1 star for this experience, +1 star for the memories.","232":"3 stars just because the food is good. \n\nService is so slow, calling it fast food is misleading. \n1st time: went to the restaurant to place an order - wait time 20 mins.\n2nd time: placed an order online to save time. Got to the place in 20 mins as per the online order, the ORDER NEVER WENT through. Guess what - ANOTHER 20 mins to prepare the food. \n\n40 MINS for Fast Food... Really!!???","233":"Best pedicure I've had in a very long time! Definitely going back. My manicurist took her time and gave me the royal treatment. I highly recommend.","234":"Very profession insanely cheap compared to others I called and it didn't take very long. They actually wanted to help more than make money.","235":"Super cute retro-chic sewing shop! It has a small but compelling selection of patterns, fabric and notions. Shopkeeper was nice and laid back, offered us hot tea. I wish I lived in the South End so I could take sewing classes here!","236":"I went to DryBar this past weekend to get my hair done for my 21st birthday. I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!","237":"Okay, I'm going to get the bad out of the way first. I have never been to restaurant where the non-alcoholic beverages weren't listed. Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non-booze offerings were. Maybe if we'd shown up with a kid or stroller, we'd have gotten the non-alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \n\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium-well in our group. I'd have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M&E's in town who do things more consistently.","238":"Went to Haru with a bunch of old and new friends last night. it was part of my \"get me the f outta here\" regimen. By soaking myself in sushi goodness, I might forget that I have to pack still, have 10,000 emails that piled up during my 5 days of death by powerpoint.\n\nAnyway, the sushi here was tremendous. The edamame was HUGE but could have used a little more salt on the top and a little less on the bottom (suggesting that it sat f or a while?) but overall - the food here was fantastic.\n\nWe had a big party, split the tables and the other side had food coming all night long. We opted for a bit more conservative approach, ordering a big tray of about 5 rolls (including the Bostonian[?] - which was FANTASTIC). There really wasn't anything there that wasn't really quite delicious.\n\nTry the Kiss of Fire - but I have to warn you, there's a fuse on that fire. It hits you about your third piece in...\n\nThe service was great. We ran that poor girl's legs completely off. But again, order a Diet Coke and you'll get \"is Diet Pepsi ok?\". My typical response is, \"well, is paying in Chinese Yen ok?\"... you get the idea.\n\nAll in all, good friends, good times, good sushi. A solid 4.","239":"An open letter to Kreuger Farms:\n\nDear Mr. Kreuger,\n\nI have been a loyal customer for over 15 years.  I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan","240":"I can't thank Michael enough for his amazing service! I just moved back to the area and need a new stylist. I came in with *orange* hair, trying to lift from years of boxed black (I know, I know) after having been told by more than one stylist that I had to settle. My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists don't have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver. I also requested a challenging cut, going from kind of long blah to an \"a line\" bob which is also amazing. I am *really* happy with the outstanding, attentive service that I received and I am happy to have a stylist whose work I really love!","241":"The food at Lavaca street bar\/surf and turf restaurant is very tasty. The wait during lunch is tolerable; which is a rare find during the lunch hour....however, me and several of my devoted co-workers would appreciate if the full menu was served before 3 PM. There have been multiple occasions during which this location has lost service due to the lack of full menu during working hours. The tatted bartender has been incredibly welcoming and apologetic during (lack of lunch service) and at these times. He should be recognized for his great efforts for maintaining service at this establishment.","242":"I went to comedor with my boyfriend for date night. I'm a huge fan of small plates, and comedor is the perfect place for a unique and eclectic blend. The food was DELICIOUS, but what was even more awesome was the ambiance. The place is small, dimly lit, but very lively. Tables were full, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. I'm happy we did, because that's where all the magic happens! The chefs cook right behind the bar. Admittedly, I drooled the entire time while waiting for our food. They do give complimentary bread to start, so I didn't drool for too long. :-) Overall, this is a cozy spot for an intimate date night.","243":"Consistently good mexican food. Not a super diverse menu, but not just a taco or burrito only menu either. Decent prices and friendly service.","244":"Still a fan of the maki and the specials, but I've decided that everyone should pass on the margaritas.  I've tried several of their unique margaritas, which sound fun but taste awful.  I had the watermelon one last night and couldn't take more than 2 sips because it was so sour.\n\nStick with their beer or saki.","245":"I had been coming here for years, but Habana's has lost it ways. The food was so bad and expensive.  Bad food that cost a lot leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off.  The drink menu does not have prices,  this is because a glass of wine is 10 dollars.  The $23 Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky.  \nThere are NOW much better Cuban here in Austin, let this one fade away.","246":"Stayed there for business the other day. Checked in Sunday night at the tail end of ACL. The staff was very attentive, and helpful. I use to live, and work in Hostels in different parts of the world, and in the U.S., and the Firehouse is a damn good one. The lounge on the first floor is a great little Austin haunt full of that famous Austin uniqueness that facilitates great adventures. The prices are really good considering the location, and the selection is also above average. Bathrooms very clean, and common areas are not neglected. People staying there are nice, and no donkeys that I could I see. A place that I will be going to again. Didn't wake up for the free breakfast, but I'm sure I'm not the first. Smelled good though.","247":"I went with a group of 25 for a fun Sunday afternoon activity and we all had such a great time!\nMaking reservations was easy and I love that they allow people to pay individually (which made planning so much easier) AND you can bring in your own food\/drink!  We brought in pizzas from Dante's and they were nice enough to set up a small fold-out table to help keep us organized.\n\nThe staff were so kind and accommodating to our group - from explaining how the painting worked to answering questions and giving tips throughout our time there (ie. \"You'll want another layer of paint on that\") to engaging in fun conversation with people.  They let us stay longer than the 2-hour time frame and only asked to rearrange us a bit.\n\nThey had a great assortment of pieces to paint - from practical to decorative.  Price ranged from about $8-$30.  Stencils are also available for the artistically challenged!\n\nAll in all, a really fun activity and a great option if you're looking for a group activity. They were wonderful hosts and looked to please their patrons.\n\nPS - You don't have to pay if you don't finish but can return at any time to complete it.","248":"This sushi -go-around is your typical \"franchise-like\" sushi joint.  Not the best sushi by any means, however the variety of items at decent prices compensate for any lacking. I like their seaweed\/salad rolls--a great way to get your daily veggie intake :). They also have three types of udon (chicken, beef, tofu) all are good, however these must be specially requested with either the Sushi chief or waiter\/waitress. Bar is good, with a decent happy hour menu. \n\nLocation is perfect! Right in the heart of many enjoyable locales (namely Powell's and other shopping places).","249":"Fabulous!! We had dinner delivered, a gift for travelers!!! The food was incredible!! And the price was very reasonable! Thanks! And the service, the delivery man, SO nice!! The wait, was long, but worth it!!!","250":"I was trying to decide if I should give two or three stars.  I finally decided based on how high it's rated.  Since it has almost five stars, I'm rounding down to two.\n\nI'm going to try to be (for me) brief.  \n\nFood & drink:  Very meh.  Interesting, in a \"what?\" kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that \"interesting\" a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.\n\nHmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O\n\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\n\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.\n\nBottom line:  If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I'd feel really bad.  As is, I can't recommend it, but if you try it and like it, maybe I'm missing something.","251":"This tucked away spot in lenox square mall is an upbeat swanky communal seating new american cuisine restaurant. The location is great. But the location is the reason it is very pricey for what you get. Went there with my husband and son snd literally had 2 sandwiches,  chicken with the bones in plate, 2 local brews and a artisan cheese and charcuterie app was 100 bucks. Tasty but not worth it. Love great food as a chef and once owned my own restaurant but the service was mediocre at best. Waited 45 mins after our apps for our main course. Tuesday night and it wasn't busy. \u0432\u0402\u040c\n\nToo much good food around, wont be back.","252":"After hearing great things for months, I decided to finally try Bambolina only just a couple weeks ago but I've already been back several times. It's so good I just can't keep away! All of the pizzas are out of this world from the classic Margherita to The Farmers Market which is a pesto masterpiece topped with folded zucchini, chopped asparagus and snow peas and finished with a soft egg! My favorites though are the Sopressato and the Mushroom. The salads are delicious as well and very beautiful! My favorite appetizer is the Burrata Caprese which I think is best in town. I haven't tried any of the entrees or deserts yet but I may need to because I have yet to be disappointed.","253":"We stopped by here on a Saturday night, and the place was full (small restaurant). Luckily, we made reservations and were seated right away. The place doesn't look like much from the outside (off the main No. 3 road area of Richmond), but the inside is nicely decorated. We ordered:\n\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\n\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\n\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\n\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr\u0413\u0401me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out.","254":"My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.","255":"Enjoyed the food, just not so much the ordering style. Basically you order as if you are in a sushi joint. You check off what you'd like. But, there were quite a few options, more than I would like to see when I'm hungry. \n\nWith that said, the food was good, the server was very nice and helpful (albeit very quite\/low voice), and I would definitely go back!","256":"I'm giving this place a 3.75.  The only thing that wasn't too great was that if you left the window open it can be quite loud.  The inn is right beside the road and people may walk by throughout the night.\n\nThe room we had was on the lower floor and it was extremely clean and nice.  My experience here was quite interesting.  We woke up in the middle of the night to a lady that was drunk singing loudly.  A staff member came out and told her to stop singing and she simply replied, \"Ok ok I'll go to sleep.\" and left.  Oddest thing ever! \n\nThe staff is friendly and there is complimentary coffee, tea and cocoa at the front desk.  The airport shuttle leaves every hour.","257":"I found them with yelp when I was in search of Stone Vertical Epic 080808. This is a long story about their Staff and Service.\n\nI had a very odd request- I just wanted to bottle (08\/08\/08 is my anniversary). I was so happy I found a place that still had this beer. I was even more ecstatic that they were so willing to help me get it. However, they couldn't ship it to CA with the beer. ( I wanted the bottle more than the beer) After many calls back and forth- I awaited an email to complete the transaction\/arrangement. Just when I was about to call again and check up again on the bottle- there it was IN THE MAIL!!!!\n\nWhen we end up in MA- WE will come by and buy the crew drinks =) \nSuper helpful! Great communication! There should be more business like this one!","258":"Just the worst. Always takes several days to get your meds. Staff is not helpful. Tell you to request refills using the Walmart app and it NEVER works. Ugh. Wish this wasn't the closest pharmacy to where I live.","259":"We recently moved & started using their delivery service.  Has been great!!! With two young kids (both under 3), it's just so much easier to have the clothes come to me.  Everything comes back clean & ironed perfectly.","260":"I've used BungoBox for 3 moves now, once for an office move and twice for personal moves, and it is a game-changer. It's a huge upgrade to go from spending piles of money on flimsy cardboard boxes that you're just going to throw away as soon as you move to using super sturdy reusable plastic crates that get delivered to your door and picked up at your new place after your move! Your movers (or the friends helping you move) will thank you too because  the BungoBoxes have strong handles and included rollers that make them a breeze to move. Two weeks is the standard rental term and it worked perfectly for me... I scheduled it so I had more time to pack than to unpack and the boxes having a firm return date provided great motivation to get unpacked once I got to my new place. On top of it all, the BungoBox employees are amazingly nice and helpful. I recommend using BungoBox to everyone I know! Try it once and you'll be a convert too!","261":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I've been coming to Brasserie for a few years now, and have had the chance to visit for brunch, lunch and dinner (and have enjoyed several of their desserts as well!). \n\nWhen my family visit, especially if it's for a special occasion, this is our go-to place to celebrate. Their bloody mary's in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! \n\nAll of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. \n\nBon appetit!","262":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! A true Foodie Favorite!!!!Always creative, always consistent! Great food indeed!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the servers. Some servers are very knowledgable and helpful about the ever changing menu items, while others are lacking and not service oriented. I know good help is hard to find, but this is something they can work on to help with the dining experience. Despite that minor tweak, LOVE this place!!!!","263":"This place is great! A very basic menu, which makes sense considering they started out as a good truck. I got the veggie burger because the description sounded unique- and it did not disappoint! The fries were hot, salty and delicious, and I enjoyed dipping them in the ketchup, which almost tasted like it had some BBQ sauce mixed into it! I was tempted by the milkshake menu, but saved my dessert splurge for another place. Super easy to just sit at the counter and get served, even on a crazy Saturday night in summer when Ponce City Market was packed.","264":"We were so pleased with everything here.  The reception was pleasant, and the drink list was appealing.  Most importantly, the menu was appetizing and everything we got exceeded our expectations.  The gouda appetizer was a revelation.  The beef skewers appetizer and the lamb picadillo were both amazing!  We can't wait to come back.  The service was incredibly pleasant. If we hadn't been so full, we would have tried the dessert.  I think this place was a winner, can't understand why it wasn't more crowded.","265":"As many people before have said I shall too say these are some of the best Persian kabobs you can get in the city! Truly juicy koobideh. The owner is so humble and says \"oh I just thought I would try cooking for more than my family\" but I can't imagine him not having thought that because where would we downtown Portlander's be without his delicious Persian food?!?!\n\nHe gives you healthy portion, accepts credit cards or cash and conveniently stays open until 4 o'clock which is later than a lot of the other food carts in the area.  \n\nIt's quickly become such a downtown staple. Plus the owner is so adorable and lovable that he was even featured in a local commercial, that's pretty cool.","266":"I've been in Austin for two years and at some point I met total despair that I'd never find a bar that comes close to bars is Beirut. I wanted a place that played good music - not so loud that your head hurt and your vocal cords strained - an outdoor seating area, and obviously well priced, generous drinks. After I went to Mohawk the first time a few weeks back (to watch Yann Tiersen play!) I haven't stopped raving about the place. It's my new favorite bar in Austin and it definitely exceeded my expectations. There're three decks outside, equipped with an outdoor bar to keep traffic from building up at the indoor bar, which is brilliant for show nights when it gets crowded. I definitely plan to make regular visits down there now that summer vacation's begun!","267":"Simple menu, reasonable prices.  Delicious bacon, and the banana pancakes are awesome too. It's a great go-to breakfast\/brunch joint with the kind of atmosphere you appreciate on a very lazy Sunday morning. \n\nSimple, straight forward breakfast option for anyone who lives in the area. I'll be back.","268":"Overall I had a good experience at Empire.  I came here on a Wednesday for a drink with some friends.  The hostess and server were both quite nice and service overall was spot on (checked in on just often enough).  The drinks were creative and got some good reviews and my scotch was neat!","269":"It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together.  Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.","270":"Clean, comfortable hotel, with good breakfast buffet included. Convenient to the airport, Florida Realtors, and Semoran. Good value for the price. Spacious lobby, and they provide \"snack\" bags at the front desk with fruit and a granola bar or cookie. At time of this stay major road work was being done on TG Lee & other side streets.","271":"At at this place for the first time today. I was in early. Coffee was perked...and tasty. Breakfast was very good. Had standard... eggs, bacon, hash browns and French toast.  With coffee, still less than $10.  Staff was attentive even though they were busy.  Coffee never ran out on me.  My friend had the eggs Benedict. Well done, particularly for a diner. Hollandaise was homemade...not Sysco.  Looking forward to going back.\n\nIf u are at a swim meet at Harvard U...park the car and walk here...5 minutes away.","272":"Got a medium birthday cake with vanilla ice cream and devoured it. Could've eaten a large it was so good. Tried Mango too and it was awesome. Reminds me of Jerry's in Memphis. Definitely going to come back here every time I visit Austin.","273":"Apparently it's a requirement to have a TERRIBLE attitude to work here. Just moved in across the street and was excited to have a juice bar across so close! Went in the first day to be \"greeted\" by a young woman with the worst attitude ever. I felt like I was doing her a disservice by asking her to do her job. Went in the day after hoping she wouldn't be working because the food was quite good, only to find another young woman with an equally if not worse attitude working. Whoever owns or runs this establishment needs to find people who don't suck life out of the room to represent their business. I would rather pay someone to go and get me a smoothie than go in myself.","274":"Absolutely overpriced for the value. I wanted to support a small business but we got absolutely ripped off. $668 to fix a leak in an outdoor, below-the-ground pipe. I don't think he understands the basics of business--a business thrives by adding value. And doing so repeatedly. Not by overcharging customers.  I even tried to explain this to him but to avail. \n\nWe will never use this business again.","275":"The Cottonwood is mediocre. I ordered the Twice Stuffed Chicken and my boyfriend got the Seafood Gunpowder. Both were just ok; things I could make at home. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was too pricey for a mediocre meal.","276":"Great stay. Very clean and friendly staff. Love the tv in the bathroom mirror. \n\nThe rooms are spacious,  the only negative is that their hallways are not decorated.  Makes it feel not fancy as the rest of the place.","277":"Great burgers and vibes. The staff is always friendly and ready to assist however they can. The food is the real star of this place. I've thoroughly enjoyed the Lamb burger and the ribs so if you'd like some great flavor start there.","278":"After reading the reviews, I was worried to use this office. I almost called my doctor and asked her to switch me elsewhere. I am SO glad, however, that I decided to give this location a try. The office took me a bit to find (inaccurate navigation system), but once I noticed that the clinic was in the Westover Shopping Center, it was easy peasy. If you like *clean* parking lots, *clean* clinics, and *clean* enjoyable areas, I suggest giving this location a try. \n\nThe staff was kind and helpful, as well as willing to answer my quick questions about the bloodwork. I showed up as a walk-in and was in and out within 20 minutes. The phlebotomist who took my blood samples was professional, quick, accurate, and curteous. \n\nIn order to keep my wait time down (being a walk-in), I got there as close to opening as possible. From there, the 15-minute wait was no issue whatsoever. \n\nLastly, there's a Pharmaca in the same shopping center if you need to fill a prescription or would like to browse a decent selection of natural\/organic\/non-GMO\/etc. supplements and toiletries.","279":"Delish.\n\nThe only downside is that it is downtown. ;) \n\nIf I didn't hate to be around people so much, I'd definitely be back - regularly. \n\nSpot on chicken deliciousness. \n\nIt (dare I say it?) may be better than Lucy's. (Shhh don't tell on me!).","280":"What an awesome job Justin did on our garage cabinets and master bedroom cabinets.  He is meticulous.  The design and installation went without a flaw. He is a man of his word as well.  He had to return to replace a defective part and did so the next day.  We live in Scio, an hour or more away from his location. Didn't matter.  He returned on time with the part and completed the job.  Justin doesn't rush his work.  He was here longer than he expected, due to the removal of some old cabinets, and never complained, never gave us an attitude, always did more than expected.  You will not be disappointed.  His work, professionalism and expertise is outstanding.  We are very happy and can't say enough.","281":"Wow, i finally get to go to one of my favorite bbq places from ohio, but here in Atlanta! There pork is always  juicy and the brisket(rare in Georgia) ia always good too. Be sure to ask for a free side of bark, if you like the burnt crusty outside of the meat.","282":"I came in to get my nails done for a trip I'm about to go on and what I wanted was simple--almond-shaped nails with a black dot on the beds + a clear coat. Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted. If I do come back (and it's likely that I won't, partially because of my experience and partially because I rarely get my nails done) I'll shape my own nails at home.","283":"Affordable prices and really good food!! What else can I ask more?? Even tho I saw one guy taking care of the tables (it was lunch time so it was kind of busy) he came often to ask if I wanted something else and how I was doing.. Service is rely good he even recommended a desert.. Going back for sure and bringing some friends!!  I highly recommend this place.. Do yourself a favor and check it out.. I had Lomo saltado Btw..","284":"IMPRESSED!! What a neat experience, easy to work and communicate with. Here's what takes the cake in the honesty\/integrity dept. \nBrought my truck in with a starting problem, left it with them and said if it's $300.00 or less just fix it otherwise call me..... They called 30 min later to say everything is fine and it's ready to go, just a quick adjustment. \n:))))) I might be still writing a 5 star review had they done whatever and charged me $299.00 I was expecting to pay at least that. \nSo in my book that in itself deserves loyalty to which this mechanic has from me. THANK YOU!!!!!","285":"This is definitely a unique restaurant! We were here on a Friday night and were surprised to find people literally dancing on their tables with a DJ playing a mix of dance music and what I imagine was Greek pop music. The atmosphere was very loud but overall the food was great and the service was excellent. Worth checking out!","286":"I really like all of the Buckhead life restaurants. When you go to one you know you will get a consistently good experience. Their \"summer dine around\" program is ingenious. Great marketing - give the person who thought of it a raise. It keeps me in their restaurants once a month and I spend a lot of $$$$ each time. \n\nAt kyma we started with the grilled octopus and all the reviews are true - it's awesome. So tender. Calamari was good too but grilled octopus is still my favorite. \n\nFor dinner I had the sea bream. Excellent. With white bean salad (I recommend). Eggplant side was also great. \n\nFor dessert I had the chocolate lava cake with warm sauce inside. If you love chocolate, get this. It was great. I had the 'nut' ice cream. Forgot exact name. It was just ok. My friends ice cream was creamier and better. The nuts made it too lumpy. Wasn't too bad - I still ate it. Hehe","287":"Did not enjoy this place at all. The Milky Sake wasn't good. The broth for the beef udon was very bland and the Miso soup was cold. The Japanese fried chicken was flavorful but that's about it.","288":"I think they opened one month ago (July 2014). Excellent Lebanese food at very reasonable prices. Not a fancy place, simple. If you want fancy, go to Al-Wadi, but you will pay double the price for food that you can get here. Easy to get to from Dedham and Rt. 1. Very good!","289":"Dr. Sabrina Marcus is caring, intuitive, passionate and competent. I see her for general health maintenance and upkeep and I send my clients her way as well. She gets right in there and works things out so I can leave feeling better and more relaxed. I recommend you see her, you won't be disappointed!","290":"I was having a problem with a plug receptacle I had just replaced tripping the breaker so I figured it's time to call the electrician. I called and the technician I spoke to actually helped me troubleshoot the problem over the phone and saved me a trip charge that would have taken him 5 minutes to do and saved me the 1 hour minimum. THANK YOU for being honest and not taking advantage of do it yourselfers!!!!","291":"I finally decided to treat myself to some skivvies that were not made in Sri Lanka, Macau, or other places unknown.\n\nThe shop is nicely organized, and the lady working there was very friendly without crossing over into a hard sell.  They have a wonderful selection of all sizes\/shapes\/colors\/styles of bras & panties made in Italy, Belgium and France.  I knew the prices were going to be high before I set foot in the store (based on the lingerie lines they carry & other yelp reviews).\n\nI have a weakness for matching bra\/underwear sets and they had a lot of those both in stock - and what they don't have they can order.  If you have something ordered, they can have it there within a week - pretty speedy turnaround.\n\nI'll be back to pick up the lacy bits I ordered - and then I can see making regular trips here to see what's new in stock!","292":"This is a pretty cool, newer trailer on North Loop right before it merges into the asphalt of Airport Boulevard. You might be tired of fusion tacos, but this is still worth a visit. I've had:\n- The Texican. Fried chicken and avocado, pretty good. \n- The Baja Fry. Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street.\n- The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good.\n- The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....).\n\nMost tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.","293":"As a Nepali person, I get asked the difference between Nepali and Indian food a lot. It is a subtle difference for the most part, but as a native or an enthusiast, not a very difficult one to grasp. Something to keep in mind is the geographic diversity of Nepal, it deserve a write up, that I my not be entirely ready for just now. \n\nTraditionally, Nepali food is less intense in terms of spices and sweetness. A lot of \"Nepali\" restaurants actually try to imitate Indian food to cater to a larger clientele. Honestly, I believe this is where most Nepali restaurants fail to deliver. \n\nTibetan\/Himalayan,  Newari,  Indian\/Madeshi  alongwith regional fares (I would be hard press to express this entirely) is what makes Nepali food. The curries, dumplings and noodles are all there, but they are different. This restaurant does it the best in Boston area.","294":"Server was absolutely amazing tonight. Food and drink was amazing. Outshined our lousy shitty dinner at Bar Louie.","295":"Usually have very good experiance at joes, but my friend's turkey burger was wrong and undercooked (pink) 3 times. Unacceptable in my eyes, and I wont be back at let to this location.","296":"SiP is one of my favorite spots in Boulder. The owners are two of the friendliest people I've ever met and the service couldn't be better. It's a great spot to stop and have a coffee or drink with friends. The flatbread pizzas are fantastic as well! SiP has a fun, laid back atmosphere that is perfect for just about every occasion. I highly recommend to anyone nearby!","297":"I've gone in a couple of times over the past year for lunch, but I went in after 2pm and they have a very limited menu, which included nothing to my liking.  I sat at the bar both times and the bartender gave me attitude when I complained that the menu was so limited.  She wasn't friendly at all and actually only served me after I had to flag her down (even though there were only four people at the bar at the time - she was too busy doing prep work and playing on her phone).  Coincidentally, it was the same bartender on both visits.  \n\nBy the way, I went in the second time because it was six months in between visits and I forgot that they only had a limited menu after 2pm.  I should have remembered after the first visit, so the second visit was a mistake and only served to confirm my opinion of so-so food and lousy service.","298":"I had the pan friend noodles with beef today for lunch. The noodles are made in house and are so delicious! $7.95 special for lunch and you get a huge bowl of noodles. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!","299":"I absolutely adore Fishbones!  I haven't eaten at the tourist I-Drive location, but I've heard it sucks compared to the Lake Mary location.  Everything here is excellent and it had some of the freshest seafood available.  The sushi is pretty awesome, but I definitely suggest trying their oyster sampler appetizer.  My favorite entree is the seared Ahi tuna.  But definitely check out their daily specials.  Sometimes they get in gigantic stone crab claws.\n\nThe wine selection is great and they poor stiff drinks.  Always a plus.\n\nThe food is pricey but it's excellent as well as the service. \n\nThe decor is great too.  My favorite is the outdoor patio and the bar that's plastered with oyster shells.","300":"Wow loved the food here! The spring rolls were divine. The raspberry lychee drink was sweet and flavorful. The Vietnamese eggplant was delightful. Very lively friendly environment. The waitress was knowledgeable and helpful. Definitely visit again.","301":"They are great ! They have everything you can think of. They always give the kids free hot dogs. They are well priced and I always get the family pack bundles. They not only have friendly workers they work hard to get everyone in and out with a smile and a speedy pace. On another note it smells AMAZING inside.","302":"Granted it was Friday but the wait to get drinks and food was unacceptable. We got seated quickly but even getting waitress to come by was difficult. Had two hungry kids waiting. Messed up drink order. And messed up food order. Staff may be overworked and our waitress in particular did not seem well versed in the menu. \n\nAs far as food is concerned. Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices. Veggie-changa was too breadth and didn't have much flavor. Chips were ok. Margaritas were way too sweet. \n\nWould not go again.","303":"Wine tastings have a lot of sweet white and reds.  I wish they had more dry options but overall this place is awesome for drinks, apps, and full courses.  I havent had dessert just yet but that just gives me another excuse to go back :).","304":"This is my \"go to\" nail salon.  I get a pedicure and powder nails there once a month, and I am very pleased with them.  The salon is always noticeably clean & pleasant.  The service is great!  They always offer you a drink, and they are sweet gentle people!  Also get a brow wax there occasionally, and take my teen there for a brow wax once in a while.\nI have used many nail salons locally in South Austin, and this is my favorite and has been for a year or so.  I appreciate the gentleness!  It helps to tell them what you want early on, as is the case any where.","305":"We received terrible service when we ordered at Sweet Mamas today. We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said \"well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes.\" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we're telling our whole company of over 4,000 employees to stay away from it!","306":"My favorite bar in Columbus.  A friend recently reminded me of how it used to smell on our walk home from class (like the aftermath of a big house party) and it made me really sad and nostalgic.  It's great when it's crowded in the spring and everyone is packed into the back patio, and it's great at slower times when you can sprawl out with pitchers and chat with friends.  It's fun to shoot pool upstairs even when the tables eat your money.  I don't remember them ever having much exciting on tap, but I could always get something that I wanted in a bottle.  There's pizza right next door.  It's chill and comfortable.  Crown jewel of the college life.","307":"I used Precision through my insurance for windshield replacement.Andrew was still quick, friendly and communicative. I was given a four-hour window for the replacement, and Precision showed up only 90 minutes into that block. If I ever need another windshield replacement, this will be my preferred go-to.","308":"With a suggestion from a friend on a place to get some dessert we went to Random Order Pie Bar.  \n\nThe location is small and cozy.  The staff was pleasant and friendly.  Unfortunately, the one thing they are known for was a bit off.\n\nMy son and I had a slice of banana cream and coconut cream.  The banana cream was the better of the two.  The coconut was a bit bland and the crust on both was hard and even down right hard to cut through.\n\nMaybe we came at a bad time and the pies weren't freshly made.  Time will tell if we get another chance to try.","309":"I usually go into places like chilis with pretty low expectations. I worked at a chilis for many years so I understand the food quality and what to expect from a place like this. I'm not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the service to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! \n\nI always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. \n\nI know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here! The chilis on I-drive is much more consistent! It's a little more of a drive, but it's worth it.","310":"I came here after a bruins game, loved it. Poutine is one of my all time favorite foods and this is the best I have had in Boston. They have a decent beer selection as well. Only complaint would have been the poutine could have used a little more gravy, was dry once I got to the bottom.","311":"Mike was recommended by our agent and did not disappoint. He was professional, timely and very knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone in need of a home inspector!","312":"Try the grilled tips, turkey or steak. The char on them is awesome. The wings are better than average and the service is top notch.","313":"My husband is from Bolivia - and needless to say - he doesn't get very many opportunities to have the food he grew up on here in Boston.  We've found a few places here and there ... a place in San Francisco (which has since closed down) and a good place in Miami - but we had pretty much given up hope around here.  \n\nEnter (of all places...) Que Padre.  When I first told him that it opened and that they had bolivian food he laughed because he thought I was kidding (\"A Mexican place.... reallyy??).... But we went and met the owner and then downed a good 7-9 beef saltenas hot and fresh out of the oven.  I'm no expert - but I think they're the best ones I've ever had... but the honey was so happy... and for that alone - we will be back many many more times.  \n\nPerfect crust.  So hot and juicy.  A little hot sauce... and magic happens.  :)","314":"By popular demand and (for science!) my beer list, I made a special visit to Grape Vine Market today.  I must say, I was by no means disappointed in what they had to offer!  Thanks for the suggestions, everyone!\n\nOne of the first things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability of Real Ale Fireman's #4 in bottles.  Whoo hoo!  Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!  \n\nUnfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything.  I will definately be back soon, perhaps even the day I get paid next!","315":"I moved to the Pearl about 2 months ago and I love living at the Louisa.  I can walk to work and everywhere else I need to go.  I didn't even bring a car up from Arizona. The concierge desk\/doorman makes living and being on the go super convenient -- and Whole Foods is right next door.","316":"This place is great! The coffee is strong, the owner is friendly, and the decor is really cute. So glad I found it!","317":"Stay at Drury Inn whenever I can. The place is spotless. I read the review about the maid service and all I can say is they weren't at any Drury I have ever stayed at. I judge hotels by their guest bathrooms. You know those by the dining room. You can eat off the floor in these.\nThat's just a comment, I wouldn't eat off the floor, but they serve breakfast, dinner and drinks!\n\nParking is free and the staff was wonderful. I really don't know what bad to say except...\n\nHere goes...NO USB ports in the rooms! \nA millennial nightmare. Course, I'm not a millennial, but those little plugs would top off an otherwise perfect experience. \n\nWhen you have an Iphone, an Iwatch and a Macbook, cords can begin to get you down..\n\nWould it cause me to rate it one drop lower...not a chance.","318":"I'm not a huge fan of chains but I actually enjoy this one.\nThe salad selection is always fresh and sometimes new.   (I did finally have to admit I don't care for quinoa after this visit but it was of no fault of the restaurant.)\nEach time I've been in the staff and been very friendly and helpful.\nI try to make it here at least once a month.","319":"First of all, let me say, I appreciate that this place exists, as Boston hasn't really caught on to the Bubble Tea craze like the West Coast where there's a shop every few miles BUT, the tea was horrible. And by horrible, I mean that it tasted powdered and the tapioca balls were completely tasteless and inedible. And by inedible, I mean that they weren't cooked properly and were gelatinous, borderline melting. I ordered a Sesame tea and my gf ordered a Thai iced tea. I see people ordering at the stand, and I just pity them, as I pitied myself for paying 6.50 for two gross teas that we immediately dumped in the trash when we turned the corner.\n\nGo to Boston Tea Stop instead. It's the same price but yummy.","320":"Good experience at Barista: nice ambiance, good service. However, the coffee was a bit underwhelming and in my opinion a bit overpriced for the quality.","321":"The food is amazing. Try the mixed grill with the yogurt garlic sauce. And you must get the hot puffed bread and hummus. We always have great food when we eat here and even though we live in Sarasota, we always make a point to eat here when we're in town. \n\nI gave 4 stars because everything is great, food and service, but the restaurant really needs to be dusted. The dusty mirror and shelves were in great need of a thorough cleaning.","322":"In the crazy weather of today (lower 50's with wind and rain), omg... This stuff definitely hit the spot. =)\n\nIt was amazing... and i always forget how much i can actually eat until I come here.\n\nYUM!  It's only a bit expensive for my taste... however, it was worth every single penny, especially on a day like today.","323":"I used to be literally the world's biggest Milestones fan. I eat out 3-4 times a week and I came to this location very often. Unfortunately, they used to have a great menu but most of that is gone and even though the staff are great, the food has gotten consistently worse and worse. \n\nI had three bad meals here in a row before I finally decided to pack it in and say good bye. It doesn't matter what you order, the quality of the ingredients has gotten worse and the kitchen staff seemingly doesn't care. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention other restaurants, but there's another chain restaurant a block away that has been improving their menu recently and they've earned my loyalty now. It's a shame though because I often recommended Milestones to other people and now I'm forced to do the exact opposite.","324":"The dance floor is kind of small, but this place is great to go to if you feel like getting a little dressed up and mingling with good looking people.  Sometimes the DJ spins house, which is the best.","325":"Tuesday morning was pretty cool went shopping with a friend there's not very many items of the same choice that you want so if you see something you want you better grab it you better buy it. especially if there's a markdown price or it's on sale.\n\nlast week I got a killer deal on some glitter glue for our project I've been working on. Only paid 74 cents each and they were larger than normal size bottles","326":"This place is an interesting combo. The chef, David is incredible. When he is cooking the food is perfect and I have tasted few breakfast creations better than his. However, he is beyond overworked an on his day off the food quality suffers dramatically. The service is unprofessional and neglectful so you know how good the food must be because despite the large amount of cons the food that David (typically) constructs outweighs them. Hopefully the owner knows that whatever success she has achieved is because of this chef and she hangs on tight. However, for his sake I hope he flys where his talent can be surrounded with equal talents or at least basic professionalism.","327":"I'd heard of Warby Parker and liked the frame options and price point, but I'd never seen one of their stores and I didn't think it would go so well to order glasses purely online. (OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all! I picked out beautiful trendy frames and a salesperson measured my face in about 5 seconds using this thing that looks like a simple cardboard box. When I told her that my prescription was pretty strong (around a -5.5), they said no problem. They took my optometrist's phone number, swiped my card, got my email address and -POOF- the next day I got an email saying they'd gotten my prescription from the optometrist. One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses. I was skeptical at best, I mean I'm used to spending 400-500 bucks on new glasses, and these were only 125. But they are made beautifully. And they fit PERFECTLY, and they don't even fog in the cold. I even went running in them this morning. So comfortable! I'm truly thrilled with the service I received at this store, their attention to the nuances of fit, and with the company in general. They make a wonderful product at a great price, and they're charitable to boot. What else can you ask for?!","328":"Great quick service despite the fact that every table was full, some with large groups. \nHuge portions, so be prepared to eat! Really good food, good coffee. Hash browns are really crispy on top, just the way I like them.","329":"I'm giving this 5 stars based on the fact that they do what they do very well. They have a lean toward punk. Pop, grind, thrash, classic, etc... They have a very solid stock of the genre, and a VERY friendly and knowledgeable. Also the pricing hasn't seemed to all be eBay checked. \n\nThey also seem to stock the recent releases from most noise, art, and indy genres. Mostly Midheaven\/Revolver distro type stuff it seems.\n\nThe reason why this place makes my list though is that there is a small section of used stock up the stairs; as I'm not really looking for punk records most of the time. The selection is random as hell, but updated frequently. I have found some GREAT used things here (Barton Smith 1 & 2, Tree People, Amon Duul, etc..). \n\nOne of those spots that takes frequent stops to pay off, but it's got a great vibe to it.  And I love to support these folks, as they seem like great folks.","330":"I felt that the menu was limited to regional fare which has been made in a gourmet style in order to justify small portions at reasonably high prices. The actual food was well prepared and tasty, but really,two small fish tacos with no accoutrements is an entree in Austin?  My husband's entree was a piece of chicken.  Period.  Sides are separate.  Now, quality was good, but if I hadn't had peanuts before we went, I'd have left hungry. I also thought the menu was limited.","331":"I find that there are things I like and don't like about this hotel. I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.","332":"I have ventured over to Wahoo's a few times for lunch and recently went on a Saturday with the family during SXSW.\n\nThe food is good and comes out pretty quickly.  It seems like a good portion for the money which you would expect from Mexican, but isn't always the case in Austin.  We like the Burritos and the Fish Tacos.  While you are there, you definitely need to try the Bulldog which is essentially a Margarita topped off with Corona.  \n\nIf you are looking for an inexpensive good meal while in SOCO, this is good place to visit.","333":"Phenomenal German cuisine! Best German food in central Florida hands down. Try the German potato salad. You will not regret it.","334":"Phenomenal, is the only word I can use to describe the food here. The ambiance, decor, beer and even service could be at its bottom and I would still drive through a Zombie Apocalypse to get here. However, everything is at epic proportions. Why is there not a line out the door at all times? I thank everyone's hard work in making this one of my favourite restaurants I have been to. If you have not been here you must, the culinary expertise and beer mastery is a thing of beauty.","335":"I HAD ZERO CLUE!!! OMG!!! I could only fit in a 30 minute deep tissue.  I walked in crooked, and walked out STRAIGHT as an arrow.  The tiny little thing jumped on the table and used her knees to unravel my lower back and hips - GET OUT OF TOWN.  I was skeptical, but walked out a believer.","336":"Been wanting to check this place out for awhile, so I came in on a whim after lunch.\n\nThe counter girl gave me the impression she wasn't happy to be there since she just stared at me without smiling when I walked in.\n\nYou can't substitute veggies for rice, it's an add on, you can only get the spring rolls fried (gross),  I ordered the chicken curry with veggies to go, the place is small, clean and quiet.\n\nThe dish was bland, the \"veggies\" were 3 pieces of carrot and 2 pieces of potato.\n\nIt's inexpensive, and close to my house, but I will not visit again.","337":"Wanted to check out this establishment last Friday afternoon,  as I live fairly close in Medford and it had descent reviews. Well I was quite pleased! Loved the variations on menu, prices were reasonable, food was tasty! They were very kid friendly as I was with my active 2 year old it helps they have TVS by each booth. The ambiance very cool and sophisticated yet comfy. Bar scene was seemed fun professional and locals that were friendly having great time. We truly enjoyed our food. Loved the pulled pork sandwich and the nachos were fabulous! Will definitely come back! Our server Mark and the rest of the staff worked well together as a team! Thank you for a great time!","338":"First: CASH ONLY! \nShady stuff\n\nSecond, this is in a lot of ways a classically American Chinese joint, replete with the metal teapot and Chinese zodiac placemats, but the manager'll be quick to point out some more old school home-style Chinese stuff posted on the desk. \n\nFood is pretty mediocre. The \"chicken velvet\" is some kind of egg concoction that everyone around us seemed to be ordering but was seriously undersalted. The dan dan noodles were cooked too al dente and they used too much vinegar.\n\nI did find the manager sweet though--he was so excited to have Chinese people come. And he seemed so wistful as he stared out into the neon glow of the McDonalds opposite, hands loosely held behind his back like my old painting teacher. I suspect that he might've wanted this place to be so much more. And I think it could be, if they accepted credit.\n\nSeriously, it's like a 7 minute walk one way to the closest BoA","339":"I don't remember McCormick and Schmick's food to be extremely second-rate. The mussel, do not get, had no flavor and smelt fishy. That is not a good sign, mussels are suppose to smell fresh like the ocean...fishy means spoiled. What happened to the mushroom risotto? Why is it not on the menu anymore?  I recalled that being delicious the last time I dined here years ago.  The hassle of finding and paying to park was not worth it.  I hardly noticed the view being distracted by the poor quality food.","340":"For my 900th review - Damien S.' review brought this spot onto my radar several months ago, but I'm not from the neighborhood, so I bookmarked it for the future.\n\nThe future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1\/2 a mile away.  Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two \u0412\u0458 Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.\n\nThey are open daily, and close at 8pm.","341":"Great food and service. Had the lobster and wife had the scallops. Both were very delicious. The dessert was the banana foster which was outstanding.  Our sides were spinach and broccoli which was ok. Hard to give 5 stars but really great.","342":"I really wanted to give this place five stars, but coming on a \nWednesday night and the place being empty, I was hoping that the girl behind the counter would explain the process a little better.\n\nAside from this awkward encounter, the ice cream and taiyaki were absolutely delicious! I got the almond ice cream made with whole milk and nutella taiyaki. My boyfriend got the bavarian creme with banana ice cream also made with whole milk. Wow. The flavors were unbelievable! Definitely a must try! I really hope this place stays since it's right across from my house!\n\nThey also do a deal Thursday-Sunday for 15% off your ice cream if you went to the movies beforehand and have a ticket stub. Cute date night idea!","343":"This place is really good. Service was fast and efficient. No people screaming from the back which made our dine in experience even better. The food was delicious and the prices were favorable. I would definitely recommend the sesame chicken and orange chicken when they have it.\n\nThe inside of the restraunt was very calm, well lit and clean. Give these guys a visit.","344":"Been eating here since it opened. The thrill is now gone but the food is still\ngood and very affordable. Like that I can hit Lee's and Com in one trip for a\ngreat selection of international treats.","345":"The only problem with Flip Burger Boutique is that Richard Blais isn't cooking your burger.  I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut\u0413\u00a9ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.","346":"It is the most convenient store to my house. In spite of the inflated prices i still chose this establishment. The selection is decent but that does not make up for the over all cold demeanor of the staff. They are rarely helpful and make this establishment a piss poor contender in comparison to its competition.","347":"Not as impressed as I thought I would be. The basic pancake order was so large, if I had eaten just half, would killed me. The service was good, but not the friendliest. Worth another visit when not so busy. 5 days ago...Saturday.","348":"I was going to leeba for over two years. I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice! Unfortunately second time I didn't get message til after I went to salon. I am so hurt and disappointed by how I was treated by Elie. And I was totally ripped off.","349":"Note to the Yelp admin: this place actually closes at 4:55 pm, not 5 pm. Weird, I know, but I went to get an iced coffee on another hot Boston day and when I arrived at 4:55 I waited. I waited a few minutes before someone came over and told me it was closed. Still before 5 pm. Thankfully there's a Starbucks coming in soon across the street so we don't have to settle when we want an afternoon iced coffee.","350":"I ate there on a Wednesday for lunch. I had the Miso soup, which was excellent. I had the Japanese Bento Box \"Chilean Bass\". Every component was perfectly prepared. The service was quick and friendly. Our waitress was excellent. I would definitely visit this restaurant again.","351":"Consistently my favorite place in Vancouver for breakfast. The prices are great and the portions are intense. Always busy, but never the ridiculous waits you get for popular breakfast places in Portland.","352":"The renovation is nice.  The bar area has a nice ambiance, and the patio is massive.  However, the service leaves something to be desired.  \n\nMy partner and I walked into the bar on a slow afternoon at the beginning of June.  My partner asked the bartender what seasonal beers they have on tap (he was looking for a summer ale).  The bartender looks at the beer menu on the wall and says, \"All the beers are listed there.  Everything is seasonal.\"  Then he walked away and started talking to a coworker and stocking the bar before we even had a chance to respond.  Rude.  The bartender continued to have an \"I could care less\" cocky attitude when he finally took our order and when we closed out.\n\nAlberta doesn't need this kind of douche-baggery.  There are so many friendly bars to go to, I don't know that we'll be returning to ASP.","353":"Brunch here has some really deliciously overwhelming and satisfying options.\n\nThis is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.","354":"I started going to Miyamoto after reading all the amazing praises from other viewers.  It is all depending on what you order.  I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi.  If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.","355":"This a great hidden gem in Kerrsdale \nThat amazing speciality rolls and one of my favourite sushi places in town and ice tried alms or every place \n\nMust haves are \n\nRed and white tuna stack with quail egg on top\nSesame crusted tuna steak\nHouse special sumo mono \n\n\nOne thing like most Japanese run places in town the the service is slow - no idea why but Japanese run small sushi places the waitresses  are so slow a\n\nBut the food is worth coming here for sure and worth the absent minded Japanese waitresses m\n\nThe chef here is one of the best sushi chefs in town\n\nA must place for any sushi lover","356":"**Update - this place is closed now - bummer.\n\nDinner - 3\/5\/16\n\nHad dinner at the Chef's \"table\" - A bar that over looks the kitchen and a great place to see them work.  Like the one at Emmer and Rye.\n\nVery good service and they selected a good wine to go with the food.\n\nFood - We stayed away from mammal food and decided on veggies and seafood.\n- Potato Puffs were as good as advertised\n- Anything on the open fire wood grill is solid - we had Broccolini and Shrimp\n- Risotto was the star\n\nThey have Valet parking and the company which they outsource to is top notch.  Very professional.\n\nOnly draw back was the dessert which was just ok compared to the rest.\n\nTip - make reservations - the room is not very big and the bar is reserved as well for seating for dinner - when we went it was a three hour wait to eat at the bar.  You also cannot walk up and order a drink at the bar since it is reserved for seating.","357":"I wouldn't say Rays is the most authentic restaurant for BBQ. It's serviceable at best but the sides are pretty good. My Wife loves the cornbread, beans, and greens. I believe they've shut down recently and I could see why because often times I've noticed you when you go by it's closed.","358":"Really really good restaurant in many different aspects. Have now been there twice, first time for beer and apps, second time with coworkers for a full dinner and beers.\n\nThe beers are beyond good, their IPA is fantastic and one of the best IPAs around. First time I was there, they had Bodhi, and Bodhi is my favorite IPA...period. Also, they have a great selection of guest taps, which it seems they are very picky about, and they pull together some great other Ohio brews.\n\nOrdered the Beer battered Asparagus as an appetizer, and Buffalo BBQ Chicken sandwich with garlic fries and extra side of fried plantains. Well, it was all absolutely fantastic. The appetizer was very enjoyable, my only complaint is that the asparagus would pull out of the breading fairly easily. The sandwich was absolutely perfect, the fries were amazing and the fried plantains were just icing on the cake. I think I will be ordering this combo again and again. This restaurant surprised me greatly and will be returning soon.","359":"I'm always down to try out a new taco place, and I was feeling adventurous ,so I went on fellow yelpers to see what taco shop I haven't tried,saw cilantro on few reviews ,and here iam,I'm  usually more impressed with the hole in the wall authentic taqueria.... The location definitely fits the bill, I think this is the first place I've been to that was across in between,gives you Homestyle service feel,as for the tacos...fish tacos was pretty good,the al pastor was a little to the dry side,but pretty flavorful,grilled shrimp taco salad was tasty,I'm not sure if I like their take on horchata, a little too much with that fresh cinnamon powder,but overall one of the better  taquerias By downtown Orlando.","360":"My food was delicious (salmon, mushrooms and mashed potatoes) but none of my friends seemed to like their meals. Our waiter was awesome though!","361":"This place is fantastic. Everything I've tried is delicious, and it's all you can eat, brought to the table. Don't expect a menu - there isn't one. The owner is a little bizarre, but every time I bring someone new to this place, they're addicted.","362":"I remember the West Coast benny being SO delicious the first time I tried it. Coupled with a nice patio and a decent view of the water, I deemed Hurricane Grill a solid B. On my second visit, the West Coast benny I was served literally tasted and smelled like garbage. Maybe the avocado was overripe, maybe the fish not so fresh anymore, I'm not sure, I'm not a scientist. I didn't complain as there were 8 of us and I really didn't want to cause a scene. The coffee was weak and bland and definitely not very fresh. Service was good though; we arrived late and the server promptly took orders and filled waters. Overall, food is lacking but location and service deem this place a-okay.","363":"Almost always busy, always fantastic and worth the wait. The meat is high quality, the bread is delicious, the condiments are homemade, and the cocktails are classic but imaginative. Always a great place to go for a greater burger.","364":"Love their calzones. Eggplant parm is my favorite and also like buffalo chicken calzone. Generous size and delicious with extra sauce. For take out for a nice treat it is fast and easy. I don't eat meat but my friend loves their steak bomb sub. Every town needs a reliable Italian shop like this.","365":"I've given this place a couple of chances and it has always disappointed me. I found the spring rolls to be average, as well as the pho. The broth was okay, but I didn't find there to be a balance between the noodles and meat. The meat was another issue I had and is the reason I won't be returning. I love chicken pho - well when the meat is tender and juicy. Both times that I can recall ordering chicken pho here  the meat was really dry and almost resembled the texture of beef jerky. Although my boyfriend likes this place I never want to return.","366":"This is my fav pizza place. I always eat here after I smoke or when I'm hungover and it is heaven on earth sister. A little pricey but I guess it's fine because I recently got a merit increase \n\nI love it tho","367":"First time back in years. The rock shrimp were absolutely tiny.  About 1 inch long, 18 were $20.  I thought they were joking.  The ones pictured on someone else's review is what I was expecting.   What I got were 3 times smaller.  So tiny they were difficult to get the shrimp out of the very sticky, grippy shell.   Not worth the money even if it were $7 as a delicacy appetizer.   Get a fish, but expect it to be small.   Fortunately the visit with my old pal was worth the trip anyway.  Service was good.","368":"If you are bored of the parks, you got to take a class here! It was a little scary at the beginning but totally worth it! It was a birthday present and im definitely coming back with my friends.. Highly recommend it, but is not for everyone.. You have to be a little crazy hehe","369":"The entrance is nondescript and easily missed, but everything else about this place seems great. \n\nThe bread, wine, salads, pasta, seafood, and eggplant parmigiana we all had were great. The pricing was good and the service was excellent. \n\nWhile there was nothing on the menu or in the restaurant which makes it strikingly unique, the location plays that role. Guiseppe's is within walking distance of the Drexel movie theater, which is within walking distance of Jenni's ice cream. This holy triumvirate makes all three locations perfect for a great night out with friends.","370":"The only reason that the Empire Landmark gets 3-stars is because of the phenomenal view from our room.  If you can get a west facing, high story room then it's worth it.  \n\nThe only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \n\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.  You have to be a paying customers to sit down.","371":"I love the low-key vibe of this place.  The staff is great, there aren't any attitudes, and they have a good mix of regulars and first timers that are sure to come back.\n\nIt's pretty big, which is great for groups and on busy nights.  There's a large patio out back, and a little nook full of couches inside.  Good beer selection, great prices.","372":"This pharmacy has a terrible customer service. We need to wait 30 minutes for a single prescription drug. There are only 5 people behind us. None of them received their medications in the first 10 minutes. First time and not coming back to Walgreens. \n\nWhen I asked why so long they told me because this pharmacy is busy! So hire more people!!","373":"I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and me. The fried chicken sandwich was pretty good. I enjoyed the chicken the most. It was just the right amount of crispiness. I liked the bun too, but I'm not sure about everything else in it. I ordered two of the regular fried and it ended up to be so much. Typically that would be a good thing...except it was probably one of the saltiest fries I have eaten. You have to drench it in ketchup.","374":"My daughter loves this place. The quality of the food is consistent and good. I normally just get the fried shrimp but she gets the shrimp\/crab legs combos and has never been disappointed. We have only had take out but my daughter says everyone has been nice to her each time she has gone. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because it has to be the best food ever for me to give it more than 3 stars.","375":"\"I overheard you are out of the roast beef, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we can still make another sandwich.\"\n\n\"What do you have?\"\n\n\"Salami and cheese.\"\n\n\"OK, sounds good, I'm easy to please.\"\n\n\"Do you want mustard?\"\n\n\"No, but do you have mayo?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Do you want any greens?\"\n\n\"Sure, give me some green stuff on it.  And I need something cold to drink.\"\n\n\"We have lemonade, iced coffee...\"\n\n\"I'll take Lala's Lavender Lemonade.  Hold the alliteration.\"\n\nBest damn lunch I've ever had from a cargo container.","376":"I love this damn place.\n\nIt's hard not to feel like Norm from Cheers after you've been in a few times, between Joe, Suzanna, Potter and Corey your drink is in front of you before you have to order it (as long as you aren't one of those Taco Mac around the world types) and there's always a genuine \"how are ya\" behind it. \n\nThe later it gets, the smokier it gets, and you'll never go home in a condition that allows you the privilege of smelling your own perfume\/cologne, but in the summer months this can be a saving grace.  No patio = less hipsters invading, just a bunch of neighborhood guys and gals out for a low key evening with a couple of pints.\n\nDid I mention I love this damn place?","377":"I love this place. Everyone is so nice. I can't remember the guy's name who helped me out, but he has helped me multiple times with all my dumb questions. Thanks dude.","378":"I've spent 20 years performing in or attending the Orlando International Fringe Festival. It's absolutely a fabulous time. TONS of great shows and wonderful social time at the beer tent. I highly recommend!","379":"I really enjoy IKEA. You can make of it what you want. I usually only come if I know EXACTLY what I need. Otherwise I get completely overwhelmed. Do your research, prepare for crowds, and get a good deal. also, become a free member. There are lots of great perks, such as free coffee or tea and extra time for your kids in the play area (which according to my 6 year old niece and 8 year old nephew, is REALLY COOL.) lol.","380":"Very helpful staff who will listen to what your needs are and offer advice. When you visit, they'll have sample stamps to look at and example fonts printed up so you know exactly what to expect. \n\nI thought a little local spot like this would be too pricy for our non-profit, but I got a better deal than what I could find on-line. So worth it! Quick turn-around, too.","381":"Kind of a \"mini\" Whole Foods. If you want a kick ass salad bar (and who doesn't?) go to the one on Ponce. This place does make a mean sandwich, killer sushi, and takes care of most of your shopping needs. Just lacking on the salad bar... that's pretty much it. \n\nOh, and if you come during lunch, you are pretty lucky if you get a place to sit; unlike the other Whole Foods in the area, there is practically no where to sit and enjoy your recently purchased over priced food. HA!","382":"Went for lunch today and was disappointed.  \n\nI got some sort of steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  First of all, for $18, there wasn't much steak which was very disappointing.   I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat.   There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat.   Also, the bread was very crusty.   Too crusty.   The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy.  Only half were edible.  The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy.   \n\nOverall, not a great meal.   I certainly would not go back given the price.  I can think of a number of places that are much better.  Capital grill has an amazing steak sandwich (with two to three times as much meat) at the same price point.   OR go to Servitzios down the street for much less he money and a better sandwich.","383":"I am delighted to be the first to review the Wave.\n\nThe Wave Restaurant opened in June 2008 in the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World.  The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.  Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block.\n\nThis place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay.","384":"Not the \"nice seafood restaurant\" my wife wanted for dinner. It's more like a lunch spot. Breading on the fish was super thin and tasteless. The fish itself was thin and a rubbery. The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1\/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren't over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai (catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...","385":"Would I drive hours for this pizza? Probably not. But if you are in the area- get it. It is not earth shattering, but just a very good pizza. Good sauce, great cheese and a nice crust. That's it. A place that does one thing very very well.","386":"I was getting my hair cut across the street when she told me a BBQ place had just opened up across the street. It literally opened at 11a today. A guy came in and said they have a special going on, $6 gets you a pulled pork or chicken sandwich, fries and a drink. It was about lunch and this guy just so happened to be hungry so I made my way over to check them out. \n\nDon't sleep on this place. I got their $6 pulled pork sandwich lunch special, comes with fries and it was off the chain good! Service is fast and friendly. It's a small place with super limited seating. The place seats maybe 15 people total. It's owned by Snoop Dog's uncle which is pretty cool. Hoping to see him in here one day. That would be cool","387":"I actually love Whole Bowl. But whoever they are hiring now, both at this location and the one on Williams are racist racist racist. I've watched myself be charged for things I never was before, even watching others not be charged the same. Literally watched the quote unquote bowler give me less, noticeably. And when my sisters have patronized the NE location the service was despicable hesitabt and racist. Even found hair in the food.... given the service who knows if it was purposeful or not.  Yuck. I will not be coming back... and this was a fave. Just appalled","388":"Super friendly service, easy place to bring the kids, very tasty coffee (americano was great) and the Diablo was awesome, best breakfast I've had in a long time!  Highly recommend.","389":"Enjoyed a great lunch with colleagues this afternoon. The service was awesome as well as the food. I will definitely be back.","390":"Words and yelp reviews can't describe the absolutely amazing atmosphere. There are books EVERYWHERE. I am a bookie but I believe anyone would enjoy a visit here( maybe not the claustrophobic ).  Sadly the renowned basement section wasn't available for browsing but only for certain searches. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and somehow can recall their entire inventory. I personally recommend coming here to browse rather than looking for a certain novel but if you are, the staff can help! I'll be back here before long!","391":"Enjoyed the fried chicken and sides. Chicken had a little kick but was lightly battered and the sides were delicious, would definitely go back.","392":"It's pretty much a staple of the Campus area - you want to see a movie at the Lennox? You go to Cup O Joe before or after. Service is always friendly, and sometimes the coffee is a bit \"meh\", but you generally get a good cup of whatever you want. (I actually really like the Elvis PB & Banana smoothie with a shot of espresso added). \n\nIt's nicely arranged for sitting and talking at the tables or the long bar around the counter, and the patio has been the site of many a post-movie discussion. \n\nThe wifi is a bit shaky - that seems true for almost every CoJ I've ever been to - but all things considered you get a pretty nice spot to chill out and relax a bit.","393":"Needed meat for a Sunday meal while on our biannual Tour de Glutton. My guide for the day said he knew just the place.\nWhat a great shop. Old school Butchers like Gartner's are a rare breed these days.\nPlenty of quality Pork, Beef, and Chicken product proudly displayed their chilled cases.\nA little bit of Salmon, various sausages, deli meats, and treats were also offered.\nA steady flow of customers were handled in a professional and friendly manner.\nWe opted for: Pork Spareribs, some headcheese (just for giggles), two kinds of jerky, ham, and bacon. \nThe result was a great rib dinner with fixins and money left in the old wallet.\nWill definitely return to this place to try out their marinated products, the pickled herring, and some sausages.\nMy only regret is that they did not have pork belly on that day :(","394":"Great company.  I've had a lot of trees cut down. These guys had the best prices by far and timeliest response. Did an outstanding job hauling away and stumping. Cleaned the area completely when finished.  Like the tree never existed. Prices and service were so good I referred them to my HOA who also said the had the lowest bid.","395":"Ordered from here yesterday and loved their chicken tikka masala! Definitely one of the best in the Boston area! delivery took about an hour which is pretty standard for most places in my area. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes!","396":"Amazing supply store. They have all sorts of stuff from fabric to wigs to chocolates. \n\nUpstairs house a majority of the fabrics. The area in front of the door has costume supplies and more stock comes out for Halloween and holidays.\n\nDownstairs: yarn, remnant fabrics, discoloured, discontinued fabrics and NOTIONS, NOTIONS, NOTIONS (that's thread, zippers, trims, pins, etc.).\n\nI bought my halloween wig there for $12.99! I was also able to find fabrics that I couldn't find anywhere...for $2\/yard.\n\nI may be wrong but it seems their trimmings dept have shrunk just a bit. For about $60, I was able to get material for my headboard, curtains, partitioning curtains along with pom pom trim for my NY apt. \n\nJust remember to bring cash or debit because they don't accept credit. There is a debit machine across the street but it's dodgy.","397":"Finally made it down to this Alamo and we are really glad we did.   I was a ding dong and not only ordered 3 tickets online (we only needed 2) but I also bought them for the wrong day.  The lady who assisted me was so friendly and helpful and was great.  I feel a lot of times Alamo employees can have a terrible attitude but I was so pleasantly surprised here.  Nooooow, the courtesy did not spread to the server but you know you can't win them all!","398":"Excellent service. I was able to schedule a move on fairly short notice, and Drew and Chris were quick, friendly, and professional. They finished up well within the time estimate l had been given.","399":"My favourite lunch place in the area. Big portions, good prices, and extremely friendly staff. This is where I was first introduced to Filipino food, and it made a good impression. The menu is huge, and a lot of the dishes are best shared so go with friends.","400":"Charming atmosphere in this hidden gem. Would really like to give 4.5 stars due to comment below but definitely deserves more than 4 stars. Courteous service. Loved the look and California feel of inside being open to the \"patio\" area. Good all excellently prepared. Charcuterie plate was fun to explore. Yellow gazpacho was delicious although it's smoothness isn't what I know if as gazpacho. Duck entree perfectly cooked and tender. Swordfish great but the thick piece I was served seemed a little under done in center but outside edges not dry so understand the cost\/ benefit. Only downside: three entrees served simultaneously but fourth (beet\/ goat cheese ravioli) was 2-3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments (delicious creamy polenta) to cool off to much. Delay was noticeable enough that a little mention\/apology would  have been nice. Definitely worth going to and would return.","401":"Chex Machin was a wonderful French restaurant I would recommend to anyone. This cozy little spot definitely reminded me of a French Bistro. The food was amazing, my husband ordered a delicious salad, and I had clam linguine with French onion soup. Also add a cup of coffee... the best coffee I've received at a restaurant in a long time! The waiter Arthur was impressive as he easily handled the entire restaurant! Great place!","402":"Slides, Slides, Slides  and the pool was heated! They have an arcade room and pizza hut right next to it. They even have a margaritaville! Room was spacious and parking was close to the room. Beds are ok. Only complaint would be that my room key didn't work the first day, I went to the front desk to change it and the next day it stopped working again. Other than that Great Experience! Coming back soon!","403":"Great Cleaning service. They were able to come in on extremely short notice. I contacted them on Thursday and needed my house cleaned that weekend for a move in. They were able to come by Saturday and get the whole house done in a few hours. It was also a great job too!. I would recommend Steve for any cleaning jobs I have in the future and have him cleaning my condo as well!","404":"For starters, no Donnie....no Marky Mark, no Paul......not even Nacho or the Mom were anywhere to be found.  OK, I didn't REALLY expect to see any of them......but I would have liked the bartender to be a little bit nicer though.  She was obviously bothered that she had another customer - not that there were very many to begin with.  \n\nDecent beer selection, and decent basic menu (as I expected).  My burger was cooked the way I ordered it.......thing is, there was nothing special at all about it.  A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper.  The onion strings were good, but again - not great.  The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste.  \n\nSo, that's that.......I'll check the place out again if Marky Mark will buy me a beer.  I've got a hell of a movie pitch for him!","405":"Went here last Sunday for brunch with a group of 4 and was able to get right in, even though I had heard reviews of groups waiting up to an hour for a table. I ordered the Eggs Benny and added the heirloom tomato slice which was an additional $2 fucking dollars. I thought it was an above average eggs benny, not the best I've ever had but not bad by any means. The potatoes that came with it were really well seasoned and crispy.\n\nI also shared the burger, which was really good and had Laurelhurst Market bacon, pickled zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes on it. The burger was good, but the bacon and veggies were what really made it. My only qualm was that the bun was way to big proportionally to the burger inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, it was kind of industrial with brick walls and in a partial basement. Service was good overall but I couldn't hear the server at all, I just kind of nodded through our entire interaction until I left.","406":"I ordered the immunity one. The juice tasted good overall, but I'm not stoked about the prices not displayed on the menu. 10.00 is a bit steep.It makes me feel that they know it's pricy and try to disguise it.","407":"Very happy with my experience here! After calling nearly 5 different business searching for a rug cleaning, I came upon Yayla. Quick turnaround, reasonable price, and my rug looks fantastic!! Definitely recommend.","408":"What's not to love? Great food, no grease, clean dining room, friendly staff, wel priced.\n\nHas the feel of a locals-only diner without the attitude. You'll love it!","409":"Amazing!!!\n\nMy love got a medium strawberry banana Italian ice with soft serve vanilla ($5). I got a small blue raspberry ($3). It was awesome. It's about a block down from the sixth street chaos but worth it for the cold ice on a warm evening. The flavor is powerful but beware, blue raspberry will dye you mouth and lips blue.","410":"I can't say enough about this place. We went there twice. The drinks were fantastic. We had a Vieux Carre and it was so good we had two! I had the French kiss pizza the first time. It was very good. But the best meal was definitely the meatloaf mountain. I can't say enough about this dish. It was delicious. The meatloaf was tender and juicy, the mashed potatoes were so flavorful and the mushroom gravy and fried onions only made it better. The service was amazing as well. It felt like we were waited on by every server in the house. If one of them walked by and thought we needed something, they stopped and took care of us. Definitely felt the love and highly recommend this one.","411":"About a month after visiting Israel I got hit with a falafel craving and had the excuse to finally try this place out. I'm no culinary expert but the food is great for the value (seriously $5 falafel). \n\nI went on a Saturday night and it was busy but not crowded...interestingly enough they were playing some super-geeky dubstep which I was fine with but I'm not sure about everyone else, haha. Decor is modern, well-lit, place was clean and staff was friendly. Order was up in like 2 minutes, like, QSR fast. \n\nPlus I got a big spoonful of tzatziki sauce at no extra charge...mmmm.\n\nThey also have some unique desserts like fruit tarts. \n\nA nice alternative on a Saturday night to the normal Norwood townie-infested bars! :)","412":"I've always loved yogen fruz, but since my most recent visit (being Saturday), a friend and I were contemplating where to get a sweet treat after a fattening dinner.  I starting naming off a bunch that were available all along Robson as we were driving up.  She was intrigued with Yogen Fruz, so we parked and wandered in.  The place was getting packed.  It was easy to see why.  They jumped on that Pinkberry-Menchi-Qoola-bandwagon and had their own version of fill and pay flavours.\n\nAfter sampling a bunch, I picked the pistachio, but I secretly wished I had a classic strawberry froyo.  I made the best of it, pistachio, a small squidge of coffee, mangoes, kiwi, strawberries and mochi balls and $7.80 later with an upstairs view of Robson street.  I was content.  I'm not going to lie, if I go back again, I will go for the strawberry hand blended froyo and leave the premixed to Pinkberry.","413":"I love Octane, pretty much all their locations, but Grant Park is my favourite.  I love the  light filled room the relaxed atmosphere, the Coffee, the cocktails, the pastries and the people who work there. \n\nAfter 6 the no laptop rule on the bar is great as it gives some room to sit and drink great cocktails.  Plus I hate to worry I am going to knock someone's books, laptop and ruin their whole life. \n\nI recommend the flat white, rooibos tea, and all the pastries!","414":"Finally got a chance to check this place out.  Decided to check out the happy hour.  I was very happy to hear they have both drink and food specials including a ladies night on Thursday.  \n\nThe food and wait staff was great, i tried the tuna flat bread.  Everything seemed very fresh.  I will definitely be back.  I do see the trouble with noise on real busy nights, but i wasn't effected while on my visit.","415":"I was craving waffles and decided to try Theo's given the yelp photos and ratings. On a Friday mid morning I walked into this cozy restaurant that's owned and managed by Theo and his wife. \n\nWhat made this place special were the regulars who greeted each other by name from 3 year olds to 70 year olds. In addition to Italian, there were other languages spoken by patrons as well.\n\nI gave Theo's 4 stars mainly for how welcoming and down to earth it is. The waffle with strawberries were pretty in appearance but a bit rubbery. Other customers had combos with eggs and they looked like better choices.","416":"Always a delightful experience.  Staff is attentive and helpful and the food excellent.  We always look forward to eating at Gran Gusto when we're in Cambridge.","417":"Wahlburgers is easily located in the new mixed use complex of Hingham Shipyard.  Easy to find parking and the place is for a quick bite to eat so don't set yourself with high expectations it's a Michelin Award restaurant.  \n\nMy fave things that set out from all the burger joints popping up are the tater tots (regular or sweet potato) and the homemade buns (not THE Actual Wahlberg buns).\n\nSimple setup inside with hints of Dorchester and all the famous Wahlberg Movies and photos to make it a la Planet Hollywood.  To the left, a full service restaurant and then to the right, quick take out.  Simple layout of a menu, choose your meat, toppings and side.  \n\nI had the BBQ Bacon Burger Turkey style - hellz yeah it was delicious!  Jalapenos and bbq sauce dripping from the homemade potato bread like bun.  then who doesn't love crispy bacon and to make yourself feel better about your health, a nice thick cut of avocado.  It was good and set my expectations.\n\nThen the tater tots - crispy and salty but you do get a small size.  I would go here again if I'm in the area and everyone has to try it once to reduce your stalking obsession over the brothers :)","418":"Strong diner food with particularly fun and spunky service. The woman who took my order was super nice and when I asked her what to get, she said either the turkey club or tuna melt. These just happen to the the two things I almost always get at diners so I was really stuck at a crossroads. But I ordered the club and never looked back. Well toasted bread, good ingredient ratio, and i left real satisfied.\n\nShould i return, the tuna melt is in my crosshairs.","419":"I can't speak for much here because I don't like Thai food (mostly the curries and coconut) but I had the pad thai here and it was AMAZING.  I'm telling you, it was fantastic.","420":"Everything we had was phenomenal. I had the scallops with pumpkin risotto. They were buttery and flavorful! The blood orange margarita was DELICIOUS. I have been very disappointed with almost all Disney dining options, but flying fish was well worth the trip to the boardwalk.","421":"A little pricey for what you get.\n\nThe crispy chicken tacos were exceptionally good, but could have fit in a lunchable.","422":"MMMMmmm Gelato!!!!\nTook my sister in law and niece here after seeing an ad and looking at the Yelp reviews. Such a cute little place, brightly decorated and outdoor seating.\nThey had about 20 different flavors to choose from...I had the Thai iced tea and Kahlua chip. Also ordered: White Chocolate Raspberry, Strawberry, Mayan Chocolate.\nWhy the 3 stars then..Everything was great except for the service...the man behind the counter couldn't smile if I was dancing around in a chicken costume. My niece wanted to taste test a bunch of flavors...he seemed bothered. I ordered a ice tea, he acted as if he would have to go pick the leaves himself. I said \"have a nice day\" he said nothing.You work in a ice cream shop---smile gosh darn it!\nThe consensus was to try the other location next time.","423":"Very professional and efficient. Federico, Alberto and Alejandro arrived right on time and started immediately. We had to make an extra stop OTP which went smoothly. No damages to where I moved into or out of or to my stuff. No hidden expenses, I ended up paying exactly what I thought I would be charged. Would definitely use this company again.","424":"I've eaten here more than a dozen times. The food is delicious and the service is great. I love the Lava Noodles and the Pad Thai.","425":"I have lived in ATL for 11 yrs now. I had \"heard \" about Jacks pizza from friends. They would have these looks of they feel sorry for me on their faces. I wouldn't think anything of it. But last nite. My life was changed.  This is the diriest crazy good. Keep talking about how good it is while you eat it. Wish you had more room cause u greedy and you want more good pizza !!! Are they slow? Its not so much slow as this pizza takes a while to cook. But nobody is really \"hustling \" in the joint. But man. Who cares...the pizza was worth it! Get some of the siracha candied bacon. Personally I feel like they should give you more for 2.99...but hey its tasty!!!","426":"I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation.  The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.","427":"My best friend and I came here for her birthday brunch and we had a pretty great experience. We both got mimosas, I got the migas (with a side of bacon) and she got the traditional eggs Benedict and gumpo soup for an appetizer. Everything was so tasty, even right down to the little cornbread they serve at the beginning. The waiters were extremely nice. In fact, we were about to forget our things we bought at Uncommon Objects and one of the waiters was quick to tell us we almost forget our bags! The wait was 45 minutes long but it was a Sunday on South Congress at 1:30 PM so it's understandable. The prices weren't bad and the portions were pretty big, so we'd definitely come back again.","428":"My Fave ramen restaurant downtown!\n\nFood\nYou get 3 basic ramen choices, soy sauce, miso and spicy miso for around $8. I don't know if it's their special miso, pork or their brilliant soup staff, their broth is by far one of the best I have ever had the honour tasting. I would order take-out just because of the soup!\n\nService & atmosphere\nIt gets loud, the servers were shouting orders over each other.  It is a tiny nook, it's design resembles a bento box, woody, dark and crammed. \n\nRecommendation\nI am a huge believer! Once you try their broth everything else is inconsequential.","429":"Nice bar. The photos here do not do it justice as it is very well laid out and has a modern feel. Servers were attentive and drinks were on point. The crowd here is very mixed age-wise but hat may be a Austin thing in general. May be over shadowed by the 6th street glitz and lights but definitely worth stopping by. Stop by on college game days and enjoy. We didn't stay for the live music but something tells me we should have.","430":"First off go to the original off East 6th in Austin.  I like a place with character and as soon as you walk in provides a good vibe that is warm, inviting, and just the right size.  \n\nI love to start off my meal with the empanadas which are great.  I have tried them all, but my favorite is probably carne picante.  If you are looking for something light the mixed green salad is good too. As far and the main course goes my favorite dish hands down is the GNOCCHI QUARTET. It is AMAZING!!!  Order this and you will leave happier and full.  \n\nDefinitely check this place out if you haven't.  There are so many unique places in Austin and this is one of my favorites to go to.","431":"I agree with a lot of what's already been written here. The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!","432":"This place accommodated our party of 6 adults, 1 child, and 3 toddlers without incident (with advance reservations).  CJ has a robust an diverse menu with reasonably priced entrees.  CJ also has sports on TVs visible from the dining area without feeling like you are eating at a \"sports bar\".  They accommodate children unlike any place we have dined by offering complimentary meals for toddlers.  A pleasant dining experience!","433":"That bar is in a brilliant location.  It offers a convenient spot not only for its patrons, but also passers-by who walk around the Mall and in fact some walk by the opposing balcony by the escalator where there is clear view of the huge wall projector screen, therefore, a perfect viewing angle from EVERY angle during a game.  Also good for hotel guests, train commuters who cut through the mall to catch the Orange Line, etc.  \n\nChampions had been renovated a few years back and their bar especially offers colorful and vibe and atmosphere to their patrons.  The several TVs, their wall projector add to the excitement during a game.  \n\nTheir food is mediocre, but the food presentation was beautiful.  Staff was courteous but service not prompt enough.  \n\nOverall, I like this bar and will return.","434":"Very good food!! I am glad it's close to home!!","435":"You must try the Smokey Portobello Soup!!! This is the best soup I have ever had in my life. I'm going to Artist Point again for dinner next month...I may see what I can do about taking some to go or finding out the recipe or something...I somehow need to find a way to have this besides my annual trip to Disney World. I can't believe no pictures of it are posted on yelp yet-posting one now. Anyways, I'ma big mushroom fan so I may be biased but I swear the seasoning with this soup...hands down...best---evahhhh!\n\nThe rest of my meal was fantastic but I just kept daydreaming about my portobello soup. When will I be able to eat it again? What's in it? How can I recreate that at home? Okay, anyways, on to the rest of my food! I had the Cedar Plank Roasted Wild King Salmon with spring vegetables, Citrus-Miso Buerre Blanc, and parsley oil. It came out perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. One of the best salmons I've ever put in my belly! I can't remember what dessert I had...but it was just meh. I'm a huge chocolate dessert fan and they didn't have anything super duper chocolatey the way I like it. The meal was pricey---so be prepared. We were on the Disney Dining Plan so didn't mind the money...it's 2 Table Service credits on the Dining Plan.\n\nService was excellent and it was smack dab in the middle of the Wilderness Lodge which is absolutely gorgeous! The decor reminded me very much of Frank Lloyd Wright with the lines & nature. I'm a huge FLW fan so I loved it! Take a stroll outside after dinner to watch the geyser and then hop on the boat back to Magic Kingdom!","436":"1. I would like to make it clear that I did not visit the office, so I am not commenting on the dentist's skills\/care. 2. This comment is about the front-desk staff.\n\nI was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it.\n\nWhen I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, \"You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I don't know where, but you can go find it.\" You don't know where?! Because you never told me\/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for!\n\nSo I said, \"When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment.\" She said, \"Well, we do it two days before.\" No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called. Then, they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment.  \n\nMaybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentist's staff would not have turned away your customer.","437":"My mom and I decided to try the restaurant since we were staying at the Pinnacle Harbourfront Hotel. We had asked the hostess if we could site outside on the patio. No problems there. \n\nWe had ordered 2 Pop (soda), which ended up costing $4, which we thought was expensive. For an appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes. My mom really enjoyed it- says it was made with lots of crab. My mom ordered the baby back ribs and I had ordered the prawn linguine. The entrees were pretty tasty. I enjoyed what I ordered. I ate the entire thing. For dessert, we ordered the lava cake. It came with some ice cream and some dabs of sauces on the side. Our server was nice, but pretty slow. I had even heard a few people ask the blonde server to get their bill because they had no idea where their server was. \n\nNext time, we will skip the pop and stick to water. The restaurant was not busy, so it was a little disappointing that the service was so slow. Decent food, good location.","438":"Found this here on Yelp in looking for a place to meet a friend near her place.   If this was my neighborhood I would be a regular.  The sushi was great.  Fresh fish, good rice, and excellent miso.  The service was good.   Pricing was good.  We ordered three rolls. miso, and edamame for $24.    Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.\n\nA few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  \n\nSize,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.","439":"Tasty grilled chicken sandwich similar to Chik fil-a. Fries were like PTerrys but less greasy. Croissant bites were overcooked and not very sweet.  The best thing was the fresh lemonade and the Honey Dijon sauce was one of the best I've ever tasted. \n\nGreat ice tea!  Most places are pretty bad.","440":"Best prices for emissions test w\/o skimping on service. Wait was a bit long,  but papi who did my car was funny and very nice. I brought my other car the the next day.","441":"The margaritas at Tico are extremely tasty and VERY strong! Two of these and you'll be feelin' fine! The food was delicious, but the portions are rather tiny and not very filling. Their mac and cheese, and their pork and the fried chicken tacos, were very good. Good place for drinks and an appetizer of two, can't say I'd recommend it for a while dinner unless you're willing to spend some major cash!","442":"Aweful Aweful Aweful service!!!! . Rude hostess, she was dismissive and didn't care for our business so we went elsewhere. Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period..","443":"Stayed here for the Labor Day weekend and was impressed. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable. The Japanese garden on the 6th floor was a pleasant touch. The pool temperature is DIVINE and the convenience of the poolside bar and snack offerings were delightful. Parking is expensive, but you can park across the street at the Embassy Suites for free . This location is in close proximity to the Lennox Square Mall, walking distance even. I recommend this location to anyone who'd like great service and luxury outside of midtown Atlanta.","444":"So I only gave it a 3 because I didn't like my sandwich that was made with Jackfruit but the staff was very friendly and I appreciate this type of business being in the west end area.","445":"I do not recommend this place at all when we ate my grandfather after halfway through eating his meal found a cockroach in his food (no joke). Then we still had to pay for it. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse their prices were different on the bill then when it said on the menu. Overall if you read this far it was pretty bad.","446":"Bloody Mary for the win! After a stint in Milwaukee this Bloody Mary can hold its own. Strong and spicy!\n\nAs for the brunch we had the omelette, frittata and Caesar salad ( with limoncello vinegarette). The lemon dressing was awesome. Portions were big and good solid flavors. \n\nPretty good value for the area with quantity and quality.","447":"We have always loved Finz (same owner)so we were not surprised at the delicious food here at Sea Level the oysters were fresh local and delicious  The view of Salem harbor and the Friendship is sensational.The drinks were very good with quite a creative cocktail menu.They were so patient with us as we had a rowdy one year old on our party\nWe were happy with everything the owner came over and introduced himself always a special touch. I am so happy to see this building with the quality restaurant it deserves to be \ninside it.","448":"I enjoyed the pho, but not the service. The servers were quite cold, snatching the menu away from our hands. It wasn't as if it was full of people waiting to be served. But the pho was good enough to ease my feelings, and it was served quite quickly as well. But then, when we were paying, the cashier was again very rude, snatching the money away and slamming it on the counter. We were quite startled and it left a bad aftertaste that erased the good mood. I'd recommend the place if you're just looking for decent pho for a cheap price, but if you want and overall pleasant experience, you might want to try somewhere else.","449":"At first i was looking at this dish strange and it turned it to be delicious. Next time you are in the neighborhood try the Singapore Noodles and of course have the best California Rolls","450":"My entree wasn't good but my husband said his was very good. Dirty martini wasn't dirty! But the main reason we wouldn't return is the BLASTING music which included rap! Not really enjoyable with dinner!","451":"Such a cozy, warm spot with a great menu of offerings. Shared a pizza, salad, and app with the hubs and it was all great, including excellent service by maitre d.","452":"Consistently great and an unbeatable price. Can't go wrong with Chicken and waffles or sausage and biscuits!","453":"So, I really love turkey burgers and this was probably one of the biggest, most flavorful, juicy turkey burgers I've had from a quick dining establishment. No really... you have to try one. Oh and let's not forget the fries, I ate them before I got down the street. I'll most def be back to try some other items on the menu (or get the turkey burger again). The customer service was great as well. They're super friendly!!! I wish I had a picture to post but I ate it all in the car.","454":"I've been getting my hair did from the beautiful and talented Kellie at Ritual Salon for about 5 years. I've changed my hairstyle several times and she consistently works magic on my head. From bringing in a picture to just needing a change but not knowing exactly what I want, she nails it every time. She did my hair and makeup for my wedding and I couldn't have been more pleased. I genuinely feel well taken care of at Ritual. Kellie has a creative eye and keeps my hairs lookin' fresh. Money well spent. Tip: Schedule your appointment late in the day, arrive early and sip some wine while you wait.","455":"Everything we ordered was so flavorful and perfectly prepared. We had the calamari, chicken croquette, patatas bravas, montaditos, and grilled peach salad along with queso and cured meat to start. The peach wasn't in season but that is my only complaint. Cocktails were tasty as well. I recommend the lemongrass Collins. Service was very attentive and pricing was totally reasonable for the quality.","456":"This was truly my best first best cuban-food experience. Their ropa vieja was wonderful!","457":"The food here is amazing... they have wicked fast carryout and if you order to pick up, the food is hot and fresh.","458":"Totally not my kind of place, but I won't let that skew my review too much. Wow, this place gets crazy busy sometimes. The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.","459":"This is a nice place to throw a party for a small child. So nice, in fact, that after attending two parties here I decide this was the place where I would host my son's first birthday. \n\nMy issue is with their customer service.  I've been trying to book a date for three weeks now and I can't get them to give me the time of day! \n\nInitially  I called to gather info about the party packages. I gave the woman on the phone my email address, phone number, and preferred dates and she promised to email me once she checked her book and found availability.  A week later, not having heard back, I went on their website to book the date on my own. Unfortunately the link was broken so no go! Then I called back to book it on the phone and got voice mail. Left a message. A day later, still no call back! \n\nMaybe they are just so busy that losing a new customer is of no concern. Doesn't seem like a sustainable business model to me.","460":"After having breakfast at some of the top rated breakfast restaurants in Vancouve and being very disappointed, this was a pleasant surprise.  Great breakfast and service.","461":"I have gone to Jaho many times. It is a great spot to stop for a vanilla chai latte. Also, to do some homework or just meet and chat with a friend. I'm not a huge fan of their bigger selection of foods. I like to stick to the smaller snacks when I go there. The renovation is an A+ it looks a lot more like a caf\u0413\u00a9 I would go to. It is also in the heart of downtown so it is a easy walk for some fresh air","462":"We were having a family gathering pn September 23, '17 and decided to order some sushi. We called the order in at 12pm, so we could have it ready for pick up at 6pm. We arrived at 6pm and the employees told us the order wasn't ready. Then they said that they were busy and had a lot of large orders. I have to say my Family has been in the restaurant business for 40 years and if we ever treated customers like this, we would have never survived. FYI, THE REASON WE ORDERED THE FOOD SO EARLY IN THE DAY, WAS SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT WHEN ALL THE ORDERS WERE COMING IN FOR THE DINNER RUSH. Very bad customer service. I won't be returning.","463":"They staff was great and were really quick.  I rented a 5x8 trailer and needed it a few hours early and it was no problem.  I'm surprised by the low ratings because they got me in and out really quickly.\n\nIf i need a trailer again, I will definitely use this location again!","464":"JRA has a great selection of rare-er protective gear and apparel than any place I've seen.  They also stock a good amount of high end mountain bikes and twenty-niners, which is pretty cool.  I haven't used their mechanics but their staff was so friendly and helpful to me that I felt compelled to post a review and recommend them to my friends.  It's just a shame they're so far from me now, as I can't justify going so often.","465":"A vendor brought Qdoba to a meeting in our conference room. I have a meeting in there later this afternoon and thought I'd call to find out when they were picking up their catering supplies. The guy said I'll call you back tomorrow and I told him I have a meeting this afternoon and just wanted to know when they were coming back for their items. He said \"hold on\" and that was 22 minutes ago. I still waiting on my headset, but although I can hear him talking to people in the background he won't get back on the phone with me.\n\nI am someone who frequently utilizes caterers for large functions at work. This lack of respect for a potential customer has lost them quite a bit of business since people were saying they liked their food and we should use them. I'll let everyone know that will not be the case. And I'll let other coordinators here know my experience so they don't make the mistake of using them either.","466":"Came here again last night. I foresee many visits in the future. \n\nWe ordered: \nLamb Hot Pot\/Stew (small): The broth was fantastic! The lamb chunks were super tender. Highly recommend! \n\nBeef rolls: Tasty!\n\nBangkok fried chicken: Delicious! Chicken was crispy and juicy. \n\nAlthough line ups are inevitable, the workers are very efficient at seating you. Also, the food comes in less than 5 mins! Thank you Myst  for offering tasty Asian food in my neighborhood at an affordable price in a modern ambiance! :)","467":"The Regents team is incredible. Although I couldn't proceed in living there, I can vouch that their staff is INCREDIBLY kind, dedicated and concerned about your experience. They probably have the most attentive leasing team that I've ever seen.","468":"This place has fresh, authentic food. It's always very clean, and the people are really nice. If you live near them like I do, you'll see that they get daily shipments of fresh food, all of which go straight into proper storage. \n\nAlso one time I forgot my debit card and they gave me a free burrito.","469":"Went to another dealership and had a horrible experience. We decided to head over to CarMax because of the large selection. Ended up working with Omar and the intimidating experience was surprisingly delightful. He was so patient and showed us 10+ cars in 40 degree weather! We were being picky . Found us the PERFECT car for our needs and we couldn't be happier. Thank you!","470":"I really like this place. I used to order delivery all the time and then they stopped delivery to my neighborhood. Food is fresh tasting and not as greasy as most Chinese.","471":"Update: I looked at the slip I kept in my car and the gentleman I dealt with directly is named Austin Slagle. Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.","472":"The Ice Box is where Johnny's used to be, right next to the Clam Box. Yummy flavors, good portion sizes, and happy staff!\n*hint* if you eat at the Clam Box ask them for $1 kids cone cards.\nWhen youre done eating head next door to get your $1 cone!","473":"Soooo good! \nSee the thing is, there's lots of places to get fancy ice cream, but most froyo is mediocre flavors with processed toppings. \nNOT THIS PLACE \nIt's amazing, seriously good ingredients and everything looks and tastes fresh. \nI got the doughnut flavor with rhubarb sauce and ginger, it was simply divine. \nI absolutely cannot wait to come back and share with friends while I try more flavors and combinations!","474":"We thought about going over to Brodie Oaks to see if the new Bombay Bistro was open.  I called and found out it's opening 10\/8\/10, or thereabouts.  The folks I was in the car with then say \"hey, let's go up north to the other location!\"  I wasn't excited to make a journey north of the river for a place I was not convinced was worth a drive.\nI was SO WRONG.  Bombay Bistro's lunch buffet was Indian buffet heaven!  There wasn't a dud dish on the line.  The spices were just right, the soups were tasty, and the naan was wonderful.  I was almost shocked it was so good.  Definitely could be some of the best Indian in Travis County.\nWhy didn't they get five stars?  Tea service at the table was slow (my glass was empty more than full) and I did not like the dessert they had out.  Pretty picky, but I'm picky like that.  I need more tea!\nThe line for the buffet was constant too.  They have it up against a wall, and while there's an obvious flow, you feel slightly obliged to stand in line, waiting for everyone in front of you to shuffle through.  I little better set up here might be good.  The food is worth standing there drooling on yourself.","475":"Even if you are not Greek, Taverna Opa is a great dining choice if you are in the Orlando area. The ambiance was great; there is a lot of noise but the dining experience is interactive. The servers greek dance with the whole restaurant, there are belly dancers, dancing on the tables, and instead of throwing plates, they throw napkins. Taverna Opa has a large menu. The kabobs were cooked to perfection and the portions are very large. Before you dine, sign up for the Taverna Opa V.I.P. card and they will provide a free cold appetizer. The only slight downfall would be the service. The server forgot a couple items we ordered and forgot the modifications on the items. Overall, it was a great dining experience and would be recommended.","476":"This was our first time come here so we didn't know what to expect. I liked the reclining chair and the fact the you get a blanket because it was really chili in there. The service could have been better. We ordered two cocktails and an appetizer ... We finished our appetizer before our drinks ever came out. I was also told that we get free popcorn which we never got. Might give them the benefit of the doubt and return again. Have not decided yet.","477":"Sampling Lab is in a nice space.  It is a ways for me, but I think I will go when I am in the neighborhood.  As it is there are several places I like in the area so I will go again.\n\nWhen I was there they had a range of food item from single serve Ketchup packages to small coffee creamers to heat and serve meals.\n\nThere is seating though I do not know what for (maybe on future visits I will) but everything is well laid out.\n\nOne thing to note,  they are changing their hours and will no longer be open on Sundays.\n\nI have seen survey people standing in malls etc trying to get you to try something but not like this.   Here come in find something you want from a selection and you decide what you want to try for free and review it.  The survey was quick and easy.  I hope they get busier then when I was there,  I had the place to myself and I want them to do well!  I had signed up online but it had not processed but they could just sign me up there.","478":"Clean and modernized since the renovation! The ideal rest stop on the turnpike- it offers multiple restaurants, food court style, for whoever is on your car. Currently, \nit boasts a KFC, Natures Table, Wendy's, and a Dunkin Donuts. Restrooms are clean. The convenience store inside has cold drinks, snack and souvenirs. It is extremely child-friendly, with clean high chairs and a kiddie eating area, with small table and chair sets and hands on games. With FHP HQ here, it is extremely safe and well-lit, even at night. This is our stop every time we hit the road to Grandma's house!","479":"Stopped in after seeing live music was playing and we were glad we did. Band brought the funk, and service and drinks were great. Free pool table in the other room (not sure if thats every day but it seemed like it was) was cool too.  Will definitely be back and hope the tunes are still funky!","480":"Once upon a time there was a tiny hole in the wall restaurant called Bonzai on the drag\/ut-ish area that was awesome, but alas it was swallowed up by craptastic Diesel. Several years later, while cruising down Lamar, I spot a simliarly named restaurant and my groupie hopes and dreams were answered, seeing as how I'd rediscovered my beloved restaurant. Now, they could be totally unrelated, but don't rain on my parade. \n\nThis place is a definite go to for delicious food. I've never had anything I didn't like, and the servers are always funny and chatty. If you're a fat kid at heart (like me) you'll enjoy their Bento boxes, which I lovingly refer to as a \"buffet in my lap.\" Chicken Terriyaki is good, portion could be a bit bigger, perhaps they just cook with skinny chickens. The Sumo roll is melt in your mouth delicious, and the BF is a fan of the Katsu Don.","481":"Scheduled a delivery for 7 PM. An hour later, after calling to make sure the drive is on their way, they tell me that the delivery man tried delivering our order and wasn't able to because the person who answered didn't order the food. To which I argued that no one came to our door, no one rang the doorbell or called my cellphone (WHICH THEY HAVE ON FILE FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE) to deliver the food I had ordered two hours ago. Also OBVIOUSLY if the person rejects the order, YOU'RE AT THE WRONG ADDRESS. The sales representative then changes her story and says the delivery man knocked on the door and no one answered at all. This is the second time this location has completely messed something up and the fact that there was no retribution for their mistake is astounding to me. Awful customer service, not worth a single ounce of effort. Also, use a new delivery service because a delivery man who can't do his ONE SINGLE job is absolutely useless. You have forever ruined wings and Brookline. DISHONOR ON YOU. DISHONOR ON YOUR COW. DISHONOR ON YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.","482":"The food here is delicious and fast! Shrimp tacos are the best item on the menu. I've had the shrimp blackened, fried and grilled and either way they are superb!  This locally, family owned restaurant is my favorite in Apopka.","483":"The new vet is wonderful and the service remains top-notch.  Unfortunately one of my cats had to be euthanized due to a combination of factors, and the staff really helped me come to a decision and go through the process (for both me and my kitty) as sympathetically as possible.  I can't recommend them enough.","484":"I visited here several times to have service completed on my car, ranging from tires to oil changes. Each time I visit the service and customer service is getting worse.\n\nThe second to last time they argued about a sale price they had on the front of the building, he tells me oh, that ended two days ago. I ask why do you advertise something that I as a customer can take advantage of. His response was that wasn't his job. \n\nThe last time I went they left the oil cap off the car, it wasn't until several hours later when the car started running rough that I found the cap on top of the engine block, they claimed they didn't leave the cap off. It was a big mess and it smelled like oil for weeks.\n\nOverall: I would PASS on this location based on rude customer service and lack the knowledgeable on the jobs they are performing.","485":"Hi Hat Public House was awesome! The pub opened up in our building not to long ago and we were very curious about the place. When we finally went, I was very impressed with the selection of craft beers. William, the bar manager, was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive! He recommended some great brews and also provided information about all of them. I was also impressed to learn that hi hat was the only place in austin where some beers could be found. My fiance is not much of a beer drinker, but was very happy to find a decent wine selection as well as domestics she could enjoy. We will definitely be going back, in fact we are leaving right now for live jazz (every sunday 2-4). CHEERS!","486":"Finally, made it out to Cafe Medina and will be sure to go back. I had the lovely lavender latte. A waffle with white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce. Delicious! And a side order of andouille sausage. I really liked the food but thought it was on the pricey side for what you get. But, for a treat I would definitely come back. I would come back to try a larger breakfast and also the other sauces for the waffle since the white chocolate one was so fantastic. Can't wait to treat myself again. Mmm I love pistachio and rosewater.","487":"I have frequented this store fairly often since moving to Allston in September and even when I was living in Brookline. The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.","488":"If I could give 3.5, I would.\n\nI loved the theater itself. Rolling back in a lounge chair recliner made it feel like I was back home enjoying a movie and popcorn with my sweetheart. The service was excellent and non intrusive, perfect for a theater.\n\nMy only hesitation to going back would be the obvious need to gel my hair and do fist pumps upon entering the establishment. Walking through the lobby felt like an episode of Jersey Shore, and the prices matched as well (it is in the Domain after all).\n\nOverall, great experience and would go back for another date night.","489":"We used Brooke for our wedding flowers and I cannot say enough good things about her and her work. She completely understood what I was going for and created bouquets that were better than I could have imagined. Every flower arrangement was bountiful and unique, without breaking the bank.","490":"If you have curly hair - especially if you want a short cut - go see Meg. I've been going to her for 5 or 6 years now and she's so good that I refuse to let anyone else cut my hair. She's a rare unicorn of a hairstylist in that she truly gets how curls work and how to make them look awesome. I've actually been stopped by strangers multiple times before and asked where I get my hair cut! Meg will gladly give me whatever cut I like, but she also gives great advice on what's likely to work well. In my experience, that advice has always been right. If you're desperately looking for that one hairstylist who won't accidentally give you a 'fro, give Meg a try!","491":"No complaints but wasn't mind blowing. Staff was very polite and helpful. Would do 3.5 if I could","492":"Yummmmy. I've been there twice and it's been delicious both times. We had the O-Ring Shorty for appetizer, Oh WOW!!!! I had the turkey burger and was phenomenal. My kids love the gourmet cheeseburger and arctic cod fish & chips.","493":"These cupcakes are TERRIBLE!!  I've been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste.  \n\nMost recently, I got a 6 pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of $19.15 (about $3.20 each).  When I got home, I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient - the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess (see photo).  The cupcakes weren't for any special presentation, just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth, so I didn't mind their appearance. \n\nBut I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste - not when I'm paying $3.20 each for a cupcake about an inch and 1\/2 in diameter!!  I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.  \n\nThe best cupcakes in Boston area is by far Georgetown cupcakes!   Their store traffic is so high you never run into staleness.  Their cupcakes also just have a rich quality with out tasing too artificial.  \n\nSave your money and avoid Sweet Bakery!!","494":"Nice unpretentious.  My son loved his steak tips   My pizza without cheese and veggies was perfect. He also raved about his cheese pizza.","495":"I had a great experience at this Dominican restaurant! I don't speak or understand Spanish but the menu was very clear, easy to follow and had English translations. I ordered the pork chops, spanish rice, and sweet plantain and it was DELICIOUS! The empanadas were also very good. My friend ordered a beef dish, white rice and bean sauce and was very satisfied with her meal as well. The serving of food was very generous for the price. I was so full! Despite it being busy, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The waitresses were all very nice and approachable. Our waitress could've been a bit more attentive to our table though. The music and the ambiance was great overall. I'll be coming back to this place for sure!","496":"Bummed. Tupelo was scheduled on the streetfoodfinder site to be at our work location from 6:30-9:30 and they were a no-show. When called, they said they were sorry, but that there was nothing they can do. They often leave early or run out of coffee when they do show. Hoping our employer can find a consistent replacement for Tupleo while the cafeteria is closed.","497":"It is a regular pub place with marginal food and good service. The wine was terrible, although I realize it is a beer place. Soggy fries. Even the bread was marginal. The beef stew was big but bland. We liked the server who was always there, sometimes too soon though. Overall a nice and overpriced place  lose to our hotel.","498":"We all have one thing in common, we're all in the market for a car and want to find what fits our needs and budgets best. I heard Beaverton Toyota was the best place in Oregon to purchase a new car. Only half true. My partner and I walked inside and asked for assistance near the Toyota Corolla section and said someone would be out to meet us shortly. We stood by the car of our choice for 20 minutes in the pouring rain and no one came. There was another salesman helping someone and we asked him if he could send someone to help us. Another 20 minutes pass and no one shows up. I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within 5min. I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options. We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it. The car felt planted, even on wet surfaces. The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car. We went inside and took down my information. He asked if I wanted to buy the car today. I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today. He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales. He kept disappapearing every couple minutes, even while we were talking.  Broadway Toyota may have a state of the art facility and greatest selection, but their service is absolutely terrible and not worth buying my car there.","499":"They offer free use of computers\nFree printing\nFree wifi\nFree work space\n\nDvd rentals for cheap.\n\nFree Recycling stickers\n\nQuiet place to get some work and printing done.","500":"The staff is super friendly and drinks are usually cold and properly made and reasonably priced! Great beer selection and wonderful gals behind the bar!! Just what bee cave needs!!!","501":"Food was par. Online dessert menu says they had a Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other. They sold me on it. Got there and was told menu online isn't updated, sorry.\n\nThat was fine, until we had the most annoyed server in the place. Received the HARDEST eye roll of the night for bothering to ask for ketchup. Sorry, I tend to dip my fries in something. \n\nPass","502":"This place was great! I wish they had more room because we were eating on the way back to Houston and it would have been nice to sit and enjoy the biscuits!","503":"East Van hole-in-the-wall in the style of all classic hole-in-the-walls: tasty food + questionable cleanliness + rock bottom prices.\n\nFriends speak well of their Adobo Chicken, went for that and added Pancit Bihon (fried noodles with shredded chicken & veg). Hoped it would be enough for two hungry humans. Silly us, these two dishes were enough to feed 3 or 4 normal Vancouverites. \n\nThe food was good - nothing amazing, just solid homestyle cooking reminiscent of meals made by my Filipino friends' parents back in the day. We'll definitely be back.\n\nPro tip: 2015 Entertainment Book nets $8 off a two entree order, it was so inexpensive for what we got that we actually felt kind of guilty about it.","504":"Smaller place in the area. You may overlook it because it is on the side street.  However,  nice pub with great service.  Be sure to try the fried Avacado... It was super yummy!","505":"Santarpio's is not just about the pie and bbq, it's about the whole experience. The neighborhood,the line, the rec room decor, the locals, and the throw back waiters all rolled into one of best classic pizza joints in Boston. The pizza itself is thin crust (corn meal on bottom) plain sauce, and the usual cast of toppings. The pies are on the small size, but very inexpensive. Not New Haven good but pretty good for Boston. Go on summer night throw back a few cold beers with a garlic and onion pizza with some friends and call it a night.","506":"Best place for wings and beer! Service is always great and food is always fresh. My 5 year old daughter loves the chicken tenders and frys's.","507":"I usually wash my car when I go home to Houston but the few times I have needed to wash my car I have been going to this location. Even though I live in central Austin, I come all the way down to this side of town for this place. I like that this  carwash is cheap, quick, does the job, and has free vacuums (actually, I love the free vacuums...). There are guys who scrub the tough spots that the machine wouldn't be able to get on its own before you enter the wash, which is nice. I normally get the cheapest or middle option, but I've gotten great service every time I've been here. The last time I was here they let me go through the machine twice because my car wasn't clean enough - thank you. Today when I visited again, the attendant by the pay station asked me when was the last time I treated myself to a $13 wash, to which I responded with silence and a half-grin, and Roland, the manager, gave me a complimentary $13 wash!! Shout out to Palms because I used that money to go towards my dinner tonight  See you guys next time!","508":"We picked a crowded Sunday to check out the aquarium.  It had some great exhibits both inside and outside.  \n\nI enjoyed the beluga whale exhibit you can view them from both the inside and outside.  As well as the otter exhibit.  The otter exhibit, those little guys like the attention and they are real cute.\n\nThere was a frog exhibit inside that was interesting as well as informative.  Some of them are going instinct, which is a good indication of change in the ecosystem.\n\nInteresting information on the north pole as well.  \n\nAll in all informative but try to avoid the weekends if you can as they are jam packed.\n\nWe found using our credit card out at the kiosk outside was quicker for ingress than waiting in line to pay in person which we would have paid via credit card anyway so that just made the process quicker.  Also, there is an aquarium employee outside by the kiosk on this particular weekend in case you have any difficulties.\n\nI loved the soda and water machines that took credit cards.  Canada has it all over the US in that regard as anyone with a credit card can buy a soda and not worry about exact change or which currency you were carrying.\n\nI'd visit this place again.","509":"Great staff, wonderful service. The wine list is top notch, and the wine by the bottle prices are pretty good as well.\n\nThe steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and the side dishes were done well too. I highly recommend the Boulder Cork","510":"I've been going here for 7 years since moving to Newton and really can't imagine a better barbershop.  Tony, Greg and their dad all do a great job and the feel of the place is very relaxed and welcoming - some of the people clearly have known each other for many years, others are brand new.  They're also great with boys, and the fact that my wife enjoys taking our two sons (3 and 9) says a lot.","511":"Definitely sweet, and definitely rich, but also definitely the freshest donuts I've ever had. Our table got the Black Betty (blackberry, cream cheese, cinnamon, and honey) and Dirty Harry (donut holes with chocolate and coconut). I personally preferred the Betty because the fruit cut through the sugar, though the Harry makes for a better photoshoot with its little cauldron bowl. I don't know if I'm ready for donut burgers, but the desserts are an experience!","512":"Dude, dude... dude! This place is awesome and by awesome, I mean totally surreal. A ghetto little gym in SE that fulfills it's functional and pragmatic purpose. You can go there and lift weights or run on a treadmill, but the real value lies in the totally old school atmosphere and the happiness such atmosphere affords. The walls are lined with old pictures of weight lifting dudes, the place is filled with regular joes in cut off sweat pants and the equipment is ancient.","513":"Last week, I had a brilliant cup of Costa Rican coffee here.  It was medium-bodied, smooth and lacked the awful, acid inducing heartburn found in $4 cups of Starbucks.  \n\n{However, one should expect brilliant coffee from George Howell, one of the most recognized and respected names in coffee.  He's the owner of Terroir (served at True Grounds) and former owner of the once adored Coffee Connection, which used to be sprinkled throughout the Boston area before Starbucks bought them out.} \n\nThis morning, a blueberry scone delighted the palette and made me wish I'd bought one more for later.  It was so good, it's hard to believe the English invented it.  \nOh, and to the calm, cheery people working the counter at 8 am, thanks so much.  You were so pleasant, for a few moments, I thought I was in sunny California.","514":"I thought this was a great place for some strong BBQ. Fortunately we ordered a variety platter. I felt like there was good flavor and well cooked, but there was some wavering in the quality. You can't go wrong with the chicken or pulled pork! \n\nThere was a smoke flavor that was inviting to start, but could be a bit overpowering. Our waitress was easygoing and attentive. My only complaints were that the only bread available was sliced white and the poor quality of the beef brisket.","515":"The first time I went here they would have gotten one star. Their food and service quality has gone up. They have really good pizza, really good wings and good burgers. And really yummy alcohol. Sometimes it gets crowded.","516":"Great service. The place looked clean and tidy. I did not have to wait long for take out. I ordered the roast lamb and Kalamari dinner. The roast lamb was flavourful and tender. The Kalamari was done to perfection - very crispy and tender when I got it home. The container holding the Kalamari had a hole on top already to prevent it from getting soggy. It was more than enough for the 2 of us. We had leftovers for the next day.","517":"I ordered a large order from here via foodler for a work related program and they were timely with the delivery. The food was delicious and was enjoyed by everyone. I particularly enjoyed the palak paneer. A quick note about the portions: I ordered from the catering menu and the size large pan, though stated that it's for 10 people, can definitely feed 20! We had so much leftover. Will be ordering from here again in the future.","518":"I wish Menchie's had more flavors. There are roughly a dozen choices versus 30-40 at local ice cream shops. Their pineapple is my favorite but they just Introduced Keylime which is also excellent. The variety of toppings is their strength but their product is a little expensive. For two cups of yogurt we never escape for under $15. When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink. If he came here, he might tear off his hair piece in frustration. So unless you are a cost-conscious Scientologist, you will likely enjoy Menchie's.","519":"Paid $32 for a complete wash, and was happy with the results. I typically go to a MooMoo or some other automatic wash, but this is MUCH better because the \"finishers\" (guys who wipe down the car) get all the spots the machines missed.","520":"Kate is a wonderful young woman to work with- professional, kind, and generous with her time.  If the lighting changes just at the end of a shoot, she'll stick it out to help you get the perfect shot.  Skip the studio style photos and go for natural light with Kate.  In addition, she does wonderful editing and will work with whatever needs or aesthetic vision you might have in mind.  Although she has done a large amount of musician headshots and family photos, she is great for fitness\/yoga\/pilates teachers and couples.  Book her, stat!","521":"Went here for my husbands holiday party a few nights ago, the inside is cute, funky and eclectic. Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br\u0413\u00bbl\u0413\u00a9e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!","522":"For a first time visit the Broadway near cambie location is a little something different. With a bar and separate fast food setup and feel, I found the Mexican \"day of the dead\" decor with pop 90's music to be oddly relaxing. My boyfriend had a beef taco for $4.50 and for me we mostly shared a pulled pork taco bowl salad for $9.50. My boyfriend found his choice underfilling while i found mine too filling for one. We chose to come here for food due to its proximity to where we were taking a class at shortly. Interesting place trying to be super trendy while still only really coming across as a cafeteria of sorts.","523":"I love the original, one of my favorites in the area (Can't beat Regina's on Thacher though.)  I couldn't have been more disappointed with the Peabody location.  Not an exaggeration, I have had a way better pie at Papa Gino's.  Huge letdown, but I may give it another shot when the wait\/crowds die down.","524":"For a restaurant that calls itself 'number one' in spanish and the best cuban restaurant north of Miami; I was dissapointed.  First, I have not known a cuban restaurant not to carry vaca frita. Second, mofongo is mainly puerto rican.  Thirdly a cuban restaurant would call their pork lechon, not pernil. Btw, their 'pernil' sandwich was salty and dry. The appetizers were good, which saved them from a 2 star rating in my book.  There are plenty other cuban selections in Orlando that offer a better and more authentic experience.","525":"I give four stars for the Manager and the food..Service was horrible, food was amazing and manager John is very experienced with guest recovery. Great ambiance and still kinks to be worked out.  Would advise you to go at a slow hour for your first experience. Have faith it will improve.","526":"I'm really not a Jamaican food eater; however this food was banging.  I ate it cold so I could imagine what it would taste like hot.  I  encourage all that can and will try Dat Fire Jerk Chicken.","527":"Me:  Two shots of Jager please!\nBartender:  WANT TO MAKE THEM DOUBLES?!!!!?  *With one hand makes a shaka (surfing) sign; with the other hand points to a sign reading \"Make your Jager shot a double!\"*\nMe:  Are doubles discounted?\nBartender:  HELL YEA!!!!!\nMe:  Cool; two double shots of Jager please!\nBartender:  *Places two double shot glasses on the bar.  Takes Jager bottle out of fridge.*  Actually they are not discounted.\nMe:  So a double is the same price as two singles?\nBartender:  Yes.\nMe:  Then why did you tell me they were on discount?\nBartender:  *Pauses.*  SO YOU COULD GET FUCKED UP!!!!!!  \nMe:  Two single shots of Jager please.","528":"Delish! Stopped in on a random Sunday and so glad I did. Normally when eating healthy I have found making good choices while eating out can be hard. But here the options are endless and sound so good. I got the Bombay bowl which was so filling and my sister got the avocado crunch wrap which she said she loved. All in all customer service was fabulous, food was fresh and totally tasty.","529":"I enjoy living at Avana! The complex is in a great location convenient to shopping, restaurants, and the interstate. The office staff (Brittni, Dereck, and Antwoin) are all super nice and professional. They do a great job with planning resident appreciation events and they respond promptly to inquiries. The maintenance crew is also very nice and responsive. I would recommend this property to anyone looking to make Atlanta their home!","530":"Mehhhh everyone raves about this place but I don't see the big deal. Staff was too busy gossiping to be attentive, food was ok. The only \"good\" thing here is the coffers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.","531":"This has got the be the busiest Wawa in Orlando! Stopped on my way to work to get a bacon egg cheese croissant. i had to wait five minutes as they were cooking, The store on crowded as everyone was buying breakfast and\/or lunch.  My sandwich was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bacon was crispy and it was just GOOD when I bit into it. Love this breakfast sandwich.  The coffee fresh, hot and just darn good!  This place is like a DRUG and the addiction has begun!!!","532":"I was on vacation in Portland so I thought I would use 5 star...... which should be renamed 0 star. This is hands down the worst dry cleaning service I have ever used. With zero customer service skills, poor cleaning abilities and a rude stuff, this place should be condemned. Do not use 5 star. I wouldn't give them any starts but I am obligated by the app to give them at least one undeserving star.","533":"Good food and plenty of it. Wife loved her omelette. Good French toast and bacon. I asked for crispy hash browns and bacon and unlike most places they served me crispy hash browns and bacon.","534":"I visited this location shortly after it arrived in Baldwin Park. The service was really slow as the staff seemed to still be figuring out how to run the machines. There was an advertisement for the YF app, so I downloaded it while I was waiting. When I showed the employee when I was checking out so that I could get a \"credit\" or \"punch,\" the employee told me this location didn't have the app capabilities yet. I got the yogurt with strawberries blended in. I was really disappointed in the texture of the yogurt. It was grainy. The taste was fine but I wasn't able to get past the texture, so I didn't finish it. Bummer. Maybe I'll go back and try it again. I hope the kinks will have been worked out and it's a better experience.","535":"Definitely one of my favorite places for vietnamese grub! Very authentic and although they hardly speak english, the people here are really nice. Will always recommend others to try it.","536":"The bulk of the stars was because this is one of the few places in the area I've seen that will seat you before your entire party arrives.  In my case, one person at a table of 7 - huge kudos for that & luckily my crew arrived within minutes of me sitting down.\n\nThe food was just ok and the service was scarce. They didn't have enough staff and the poor server was hustling, he just rarely got around to us - a couple got up from the table to order drinks at the bar. \n\nI did love the chips & hot sauces and we ordered guacamole. The $9 price of the guac is steep for small serving but still was the most favorite & most flavorful part of my meal.","537":"great lunch special $5.50 - chicken teriyaki and soda.\n\nclean, nicely decorated establishment.\n\na good choice of sauces to douse with -  Load up the Siracha 'til my nose runs and runs","538":"I love Retro game night!  This was my fourth time! And I signed up for an annual pass. Even more excited for their upcoming events and exhibits. \nThe history center has something for everyone! I love that they are in an old courthouse too. There are several floors and rooms to explore. \nThe staff has always been friendly,  knowledge and welcoming.","539":"After only about a 20 minute wait on a busy weekend night, the friendly staff was able to get our party of 12 (8 kids!) seated and we were soon thoroughly enjoying a great Mexican dinner with nice portions.  This place will definitely be on our list each time we visit the Orlando area.","540":"I've frequented this location a few times over my older years, but not since getting involved more with Yelp. I've always been relatively pleased with Home Depots, in general. \n\nThis time, I stopped by to see what shower heads they had to offer. Upon passing through the front doors, I was pleasantly greeted by a woman - power to the female fixer-uppers in this world!! I'm not one to search and search on my own for a product. My personal motto: If they work there, they should know their establishment.\" The lady asked if there was anything she could help with, so I took advantage, and asked away. She pointed met the exact section and aisle. BAM! Get 'er done. Found the end cap, studied the selection, made a choice, and headed to the register.","541":"A Dive Bar in every sense of the word. You walk in and you're immediately greeted with the smell of a place that still always you to smoke inside, now at 2am when I've been drinking and bar hopping for hours I don't mind this, at 6 in the afternoon I recognize it and can do without it. \n\nIt's dimly lit and their are Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling which is a nice touch. There are two pool tables by the entrance and a modern juke box to select your favorite tunes you enjoy listening to. What Dive Bar wouldn't be complete without an ATM inside? The bar itself is long with plenty of sits and the drinks are cheap which I love.\n\nThere are a mix of booths, high tables and bar chairs and it's a pretty spacious bar, if you love the neighborhood bar feel this may be the place for you!","542":"Great food & Service,glad i stopped in for the 1st time,may u all have a great 2018. buy local stay local,thank you","543":"I had a piece of metal stuck in my tire so I went over to Leal's. They patched the tire in 15 minutes for $15 and I was on my way. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient.  Highly recommend!","544":"Love this place!!  No matter what lady I get she always does a perfect job.  The service has always been quick and neat, and a mani\/pedi is only $30.","545":"Great value, lots of gluten free options and very nice staff.","546":"I love this place! I have lost several inches all over since I started about a month ago. I've only been to Robert's class in the afternoon, but I hear the other instructors are awesome! Robert is very helpful and professional. The gym is clean with no weird gym smells.","547":"This was by far the worst timeshare experience! HORRIBLE customer service, we actually had some employees snap at us! We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn't sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for. Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day. The dryer didnt work. I complained & was told that it just doesnt work well.... after 2.5hrs our clothes were still wet! My fridge broke, they came & turned the setting to \"coldest\" & called it fixed! It BROKE, settings cease to be relevant. They didnt come back to repair or replace itn just let me wait. W had to have security let us into our room 1-3 times per day. Security snapped at us & insisted that we put it next to our phone which we did not. Nobody smiles, it must suck to work there? Waiting for security & maintenance & having damp clothes laying across everything to dry, then having to repack, move to a different condo then unpack AGAIN wasted a full day of our trip. One employee (Ana Delis) cut me off & went off on me when I told her the problems with my condo. She basically told me to tell it to someone else, she isn't responsible for our condo problems but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH RUDER!! This has been an absolute nightmare. I'd never own after knowing what kind of rude people they hire. Seriously... stay away from Westgate lakes orlando... the worst! I actually was in tears during our vacation because of Westgate employees & the condo.","548":"Good quality, affordable, men's hair cuts.  What more can one ask for?","549":"Nice place, good people, huge menu. Toast burned, but potatoes, poached egg and oatmeal were very good. I did not even ask for almond or soy milk for the coffee. Woburn is not progressive. Reasonable prices.","550":"The 2 stars are for great variety. I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....","551":"The best corned beef hash I have ever had on the north shore. Fast and polite service.","552":"Been here twice. Both times had amazing (5 star) food. The first time around I had some delicious sushi and the second time I had the stir-fry oxtopus that was out of this world! Service been average both times. Will totally be back for some more of the yummy food!","553":"I had a great experience at this pep boys and thought I would share.  My brakes started grinding last week so I got it in there as fast as I could.  This location is very convenient to where I work so I thought I would give them a try.  When I came in, I was greeted by Lawrence who was very friendly and told me he would call me as soon as he had a chance to look at them.  He called back around 30 min later to let me know both sets of brake pads needed to be replaced as well as the rotors on the back set.  Lawrence was willing to send me photos and  give me coupons to help with the price.  I would definitely bring my car here again for repairs and ask specifically for Lawrence.  I am glad I now have a go-to place that is also very convenient!","554":"As they say, you get what you pay for. It could be true for some of the luxurious purchases we've had. Some just ride on their name but truly their quality is awful. \n\nWhat made Tanner Goods stand out is they are local. They have excellent service and gives advice for people like me who needs advice in how to keep my denim well. Yes, besides leather goods they also sell clothes. A bit spendy than most generic stores that you might go like Macy's, Target, Fred Meyer but they all pale in comparison when you'll compare the details of merchandise they have. \n\nSure, I could use a nice pencil. Mind you, they are cute but not for $10. But there are items like shirts, key fobs, coasters that are also well made and could fit your budget. \n\nThis is the place if you're looking to give me a gift. Don't worry, I accept gifts for any occasion. I don't need to have a local and US made product all the time but when I can, I do it right. And this is the place for some of it.","555":"I just discovered this gem yesterday when I was only seeking a brow wax. Jessica took such good care of me. It was the best chocolate wax ever! \nI had to come back the very next day for the best facial. I'm super pleased. This is my new fave place for sure.","556":"My girlfriend and I stopped by Retro Station after hearing that there were new owners. As soon as we walked in, we noticed the changes. The atmosphere is a fun, 50's theme. Very cool. We ordered the cheese garlic bread and a deep dish pizza. I must tell you, the garlic bread was exceptional and the pizza is one of the best I have tried in a long time. The service was awesome and the owners are the sweetest people. They have really turned the place around. They made us feel like very special customers and made sure that we enjoyed our night. We will definitely be going back!!","557":"I'm confused at how this place has any stars.  The food is not what we expected at all. It was dry tasteless and completely unappetizing. The I got two tacos, I cant even remember which ones, but one had this weird mayonnaise based sauce, the fish was hard, the cajun fries were very salty and came with some orange mayo like sauce,  the kids chicken tenders were hard as rocks and looked like the once you can get in the frozen section at Walmart, the shrimp appetizer was hard as rocks and swimming in some runny sauce, just completely unedible. I mean when our little ones don't want to eat the food, we know its bad... The place was just disgusting, the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky. Yuck. We will never come back to thus place. We spent about $60 and left hungry. NEVER AGAIN","558":"I was looking forward to shopping at Sprouts.  It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No \"thank you\", no \"do you need a hand\", not even the now common \"there you go\".  \n\nThe place just opened! Haven't they trained the staff any customer service skills? I won't be going back.  \n\nAnd, the prices are not that great.  They have fake specials - 1 pound packages of strawberries @ 2 for $5 but a 2 pound package for $3.98. Similar with blueberries.  And many empty produce bag dispensers.  Management needs to wake up.","559":"The best fried clams in the city (state? East coast?) are served at B&G, no question.  Add the freshly made tartar sauce and it's heavenly!  A good secret is that they take reservations on the day-of, after 11am.  Sometimes you'll get stuck at a table that's too small for your party, but if you improvise, share plates and get cozy, you'll have a great time!  Or sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare each plate and shuck oyster after oyster - you'll even get to see Barbara in action every now and then. Try the rieslings that are on the wines-by-the-glass menu as a great complement to a salty, briny oyster plate.  And save room for dessert!!","560":"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...\n\nThe host greeted us, not by saying \"welcome to BJs,\" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. \n\nThe place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar\/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.\n\nWell--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. \n\nI never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. \n\nInstead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.\n\nAnyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape\u0413\u00b1o burger, which came with fried jalape\u0413\u00b1os. The burger had only a couple of jalape\u0413\u00b1os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.\n\n\nWhatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.","561":"I went there tonight for my second time. I just moved to Columbus within the last 4 months. The first time I went I ordered the Hoffbrau Schnitzel. It was really good. Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. \n\nI went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!","562":"I cannot tell you if it is authentic Cuban food or not since I am not Cuban,but after eating so much Cuban food for a year in the Mecca of Cuban food in the country (Miami) I believe my review could be a helpful. I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.","563":"I just recently bought a 2017 Toyota Camry se and couldn't be more happy. The sales guy Mati was very professional and answered all my questions and was very nice. I traded in my 2014 Toyota Tacoma which had a salvaged title which I found out about two years later and they basically paid it off for me. Every other dealerships I went to didn't come close to what Beaverton Toyota offered me for Tacoma so I made right choice going back 2 days later.  Got a brand new car and happy to get out of my salvaged Tacoma. Mati was Outstanding and would definetly recommend this place to anyone who wants to purchase a vehicle.","564":"I've been coming to Modern Pilates off and on for 2 years. I'm back on again and really a fan of their new studio space, which they've been in since sometime last year (2011).\n\nPilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach.\n\nThey really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs.\n\nIf anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess. The staff does a nice job with customer service as well, but sometimes last minute changes can be difficult.\n\nOverall, I have no problem recommending this place for anyone who's looking for a great Pilates workout!","565":"Excellent food and service.   I had Wonton soup and Szechuan Chicken, both tasted very good, and were presented well.   Several nice touches in the service, and a friendly and welcoming staff.  This is a hidden gem in Orlando.","566":"There are so few coffee shop options up north beside the typical Starbucks chains, so I was pretty stoked to find this place by stumbling across their groupon deal.They always seem to have a living social or groupon online!\n\nThere's a limited amount of seating and plugs on the wall, but I haven't had any problems since I've only been here on a weekday. Great atmosphere to get some work done.\n\nMy favorite is the iced chai so far since I have a sweet tooth with my drinks and their menu definitely has a lot more of those for me to try. It also helps they have food on their menus in case you want to work through lunch and stays all day.","567":"Never met a Cactus Club I didn't like! \n\nHave eaten here twice in the last week, both times because this location tends to be less crowded than the other Cacti in Vancouver, and I'm always sure to get a booth here. The service leaves little room for fault-finding, and the food is standard Cactus fare -- i.e., predictably good (but not outstanding -- i.e., exactly what one comes to Cactus for). \n\nThe men's room is clean, spacious, and well appointed with couch and fireplace. Aaaaaand, the servers are good at, and seem to enjoy, their jobs, which makes all the difference in the dining experience. \n\nFor anyone seeking a very satisfying dinner for two for under $100, Cactus is a great go-to option.\n\nWell deserved 5-stars.","568":"I bought a groupon for two for $59.00 for the sushi making class. It was a really great deal when a regular class at full price is $60.00 each person.\n\nThe location is pretty nice. Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. \n\nThe actually restaurant was small.  Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations.\n\nThis is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23.\nSo this very small room because CRAMPED.\n\nI went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a  spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi.\n\nThere were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??'  So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. \n\nWe ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others.\n\nThe teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. \n\nWe took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. \n\nAll in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time.","569":"Thank you for the beautiful work on my daughter's nails. This was a special treat for her birthday! Now my husband wants to come in for a massage. \n\nVery clean salon and nice people.","570":"Called these guys up at 11pm the other night to get some much needed group for my well-drank and poorly fed group. We ordered onion rings as an app (super oily and terrible for you but hey that means they actually taste good). \n\nOne guy somehow ordered more plates of food than would fit on the table and they were gone within 15 minutes. I would assume he liked his.\n\nI ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which I've had many times and always love. The only issue with the sandwich is that it has the Captain Crunch effect on the roof of my mouth? Weird, but worth the trouble.\n\nAnyways, it's quite nice that this place has a kitchen open til 1am. Seriously? I had no idea you could get good food like this that late. If you come for lunch or dinner, you may have to wait, but it's worth it.\n\nThis is also the place that I took my girlfriend on our first date. Since the food was really good and our mouths were always full, it cut back a bit on the awkwardness.","571":"Two stars for friendly service and base for seating. However my experience with the meal was Far Beyond and satisfactory. So much so that I did not finish my meal. My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!\n\nI expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich. The few people that we saw eating the chicken sandwich had actually deconstructed it and ate it with fork and knife. I was incredibly unhappy with the quality of my meal I couldn't even finish it! I ended up leaving and going to chicken and gun and thoroughly enjoyed my meal there! I'm upset that we had to waste 30 plus dollars to find out that this place was just another fail of a good review location","572":"My experience at the caf\u0413\u00a9 was not what I expected. I had read and heard great reviews about the food and was disappointed when I tried the pork flatbread sandwich and the hand pulled flat noodles. \nThe flatbread sandwich was sub-par due to the fact that the pork was dry and bland while the bread was tasteless.\nThe noodles were good, but I did not get as much flavor as expected from the dish. Having tasted other Chinese places in Chinatown, I cannot get myself to give this place more than 2 stars. Furthermore, the atmosphere was fine but I wish it was better as there was no A\/C on a hot humid day, napkins were like tissues and the place only took cash.","573":"I'm a pretty health conscious guy who doesn't eat many donuts in a year, but when I do ..... it's going to be Blue Star or Pip's. Each Blue Star location has a unique selection of consistently high quality donuts that are just interesting and weird enough to make stopping in a treat. And unlike the pink-boxed donuts everyone lines up for, Blue Star's donuts aren't giant, obscenely sugary, relatively flavorless, or greasy. In fact, they're exactly the opposite: compact in size, strong in flavor, and fresh tasting. \n\nWhen you want to break your diet or treat yourself, friends, and family, to foodie Portland, Blue Star is the place to go.","574":"Great food. Recommend the grilled shrimp app, white bean soup, Brussels sprouts, risotto, and lamb. Great wine selection and interesting cocktail menu. \n\nGood service. Friendly hostess and server. Good wine presentation. Nice outdoor seating. \n\nThe fire pits outside are fabulous and offer something different. Call ahead to reserve one. Upscale ambience.","575":"Delicious crepes in a wide variety. I haven't been tempted to try anything other than the sweet crepes, but those are quite tasty. \n\nThe loyalty card is a good bargain too.","576":"So delicious! Came here with a friend after taking a pole dancing class nearby. Good quality espresso and the salmon toast was delicious! I'm definitely coming back :)","577":"I've had the pleasure of working with Mandy at a number of weddings and also being a part of the weddings & special events industry, I can see the difference between a quality planner and a hack in this saturated landscape.  Mandy is absolutely of the former, with the rare quality of being on top of her game -- yet is always calm and collected.  Never during the events I worked with her did I sense that she was overwhelmed and everything always went off smoothly and without a hitch!  A Planner's vibe sets the tone for the rest of the vendors working an event and if I had a Planner like Mandy to work with every weekend, I'd jump on the opportunity.","578":"This might be the best Chinese buffet in Austin Texas. Clean, friendly, with good food as long as you go during lunch or dinner hours (it gets pretty stale during off hours, but that seems to be an issue with most buffet places). Their sushi bar is out of this world with freshness and selection. I've been going here for years, and I'd say 80% of my trips have been very satisfactory, with my only so-so experiences being when I've gone during off hours. The dessert bar is okay, but they have a ton of fresh fruit and their apple crisp is very good.","579":"Great atmosphere and music! Food was awesome! Best Fish Tacos I've ever had! Jerk Chicken Pasta was even better!","580":"The hotel is nice and comfortable, but the billing department is terrible. I needed an itemized receipt to be reimbursed by my job and I left the billing department 4 messages over the course of 2 weeks after they billed my card a week late for charges that I did not know that I would be billed for.  I had to involve Starwood AND call and speak with the general manager before the billing department would send me an itemized bill. It was so frustrating....if you stay here, get a copy of EVERYTHING before you leave because clearly they don't know.","581":"Amazing family run northern Indian cuisine. The food is very authentic. It's just as good or if not better than one of the top ranked Indian restaurants in NYC off 53rd and 2nd. You can taste each spice in the chicken vindaloo. Beware ordering your dish spicy. It will make you sweat. Stick with medium. Two thumbs up!","582":"My favorite pizza place in Portland. Great place to stop in for a slice. Crispy, thin crust with delicious ingredients. Also cool that the offer homemade sodas with unique flavors.","583":"We ordered a lot of food, and every single the we ordered was good. I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.","584":"The Rosewood Chiropractic staff treated me kindly, and with care.  It was difficult to schedule an appointment online (within a two week range) for a male massage therapist.  However, the male that I was scheduled with was fantastic!  He listened and worked on problem areas. I highly recommend this facility to anyone looking for a massage that exceeds expectations!","585":"As a celiac diner, I had an incredible experience at Pammy's for my anniversary dinner. Our waiter, Blake, was super knowledgeable and attentive, and asked the kitchen about anything that he wasn't 100% sure about. The food was delicious-- everything from the antipasti board to the asparagus to the gluten free pasta. Cool and inviting ambiance, lively without being too loud to talk, friendly staff, the full package. Definitely lived up to the hype.","586":"I really want to like this place because it is close to home and they have a lovely outdoor patio that's twice as big as the restaurant. The food and service though have been completely average to disappointing on my last couple of visits. I was just there a few nights ago with a party of 7, the waiter, who is Italian and speaks English with a very heavy accent (and therefore hard to understand at times) was rude and aggressive. He talked over people when they asked questions about the menu and wasn't helpful with any answers, someone asked about the clam pasta entree and he said \"it's clams and spaghetti\"... it was awkward. He didn't suggest or ask if anyone wanted wine or drinks so we had to ask for them, he didn't ask if anyone wanted coffee or dessert so we had to ask for both. The service was slow, we were there over 3 hours. Two people at the table ordered the clam pasta and both thought it was completely bland, the other entrees were fine but not fantastic.","587":"I used this company to move from NW Portland to Vancouver. The two guys from Willamette Valley Moving did a great job. They were very efficient and quick. They basically started running the minute they pulled in to my driveway and didn't stop until the move was done. I had everything organized and packed up which helped with the efficiency. I had a simple move so the two hour minimum worked perfectly for me, and they certainly earned their tip!","588":"This was my first time at Papi's and I fell in LOVE with it!! The ambience is very trendy with the perfect Latin flair to it. The food, so tasteful!! I loved how juicy my chicken was, and the seasoning was on point!!! The service there is also very friendly and helpful! I will most definitely be returning here. I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the pricing was very reasonable! Loved it here!!","589":"I have been taking Pilates classes at Body Mechanics for the last two years.  They have changed everything about my body.  The level of care and quality of teaching is unparalleled.  The staff and members are like a family and everyone is welcomed and encouraged.  All of the teachers spend time with each student whether in an amazing individual session or in a class.  You are always shown the correct position and given modifications if you need them.  You can always find a class that fits your schedule and none will disappoint.  I really encourage everyone to take advantage of the private sessions as it will change your life.  You won't find a better Pilates studio in Portland.","590":"I love Forest Park. I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.","591":"I can't knock the food, because it's pretty good albeit overpriced. The whole host\/waiting\/seating situation there is ridiculous! I get that you want the \"entire party\" to be there before seating would-be diners, but you don't need to be a complete a$$ about it.\n\nI had a party of 3, waiting on 2 more people, we knew we would have to wait to be seated but the host seemed like he would seat our partial party if we came back in a few minutes once the table was cleared.\n\nIt was freezing and pouring that day and we didn't want to be one of the many annoying people that crowd the entry, so we hung out outside. About 10 minutes passed and our youngest diner (17) went into the door to see if we could possibly sit. As SOON as the kid went in through the door, the host freaked out and told him to go back outside.\n\nI thought that this was an extremely inappropriate way to talk to anyone. We were bringing in a party of 5 to drop at least $100 on breakfast. We left and got breakfast at Acme Cafe, and banned Medina in the process.","592":"Is there an option for no stars?\n\nI am a university student (obviously) and I eat here quite often. I commute 1.5 hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch -- so Subway is always the best bet. Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It's actually quite perfect.\n\nThe reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!?\n\nI would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper. Ayyyya.","593":"After searching for reasonably priced\/good quality nail places in the tri-cities, I am happy to have for Elegancy Nail! Seriously awesome service, relaxing atmosphere and fantastic pricing. A lot of nail places you feel rushed through, but Elegancy gives you a true 'spa' like experience.\n\nFurthermore, they gel colour polish manicure I did lasted 3 weeks! No chipping, no flaking.","594":"I don't know why the other people have given them a bad review.  I ordered a lot of food last night for a birthday party.  Not only was the food FANTASTIC , the people were very helpful in determining how much food I would  need. The service was fast, the process was easy and they were very nice.  I will go back for sure and would tell my friends to do so as well!","595":"Leaky Roof is one of our favorite places for date night.  You really can't beat the country fried chicken - I don't think I've ever had a better one.  Also, the shepherd's pie is great, and I also love the salads and burgers.  The fire is cozy, and it's often possible to get good deals through Groupon or their direct text deals.\n\nThere are a few dishes that I would not recommend - the salmon on the cedar plank was quite dry the one time I had it.  And the smoked platter was not my favorite.  That could be personal taste, though.\n\nGreat Happy Hour, but can be crowded unless you show up early...","596":"Love RF - always dependable, always reliable.  Great bar, extensive, but reasonably priced wine list. Had one of my faves - pork carnitas.  Pull off chunks of nest, wrap them in melt in our mouth pillows of flour tortillas, and there isn't much better.","597":"I recently had Texas Flooring install hardwoods in my house as well as carpet and they did a exceptional job. They came to my house with in 24 hours of taking my phone call to measure. They provided me with a very competitive quote compared to other companies I had already spoken to. Billy was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. Texas Flooring even picked up and delivered my wood  free of charge. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great flooring and carpet installers.","598":"I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!","599":"Very nice Ambience, Service was great and Food is Delicious! My husband and I love Indian food and this is our first time here and what a great first impression for this place! Love it and would definitely recommend!","600":"Gorgeous resort.  My girlfriend got a great deal for a non-savanna view room.  Upon check in I asked if it was possible to get an upgrade.  They accommodated and gave us a room overlooking the savanna, near their farm.  What a great view!  Early in the morning it seemed like every animal on the property would flock here.  The resort itself is absolutely beautiful.  Each evening we would just wander around.  We ate at Sanaa and Boma.  Both were great, but after 2 nights, I was ready for some non-African food.  The only downside is that the resort is far from all the other resorts and parks (except Animal Kingdom) though taking the buses was convenient.","601":"Food was okay. Nothing to brag about. Small portions. Won't go back there anytime soon.","602":"I got takeout of house Lo Mein, bamboo shoot in chilli oil, mapo tofu with pork, Jin's schiuan beef, slice roast beef tendon and crab Rangoon.  I was very disappointed with their Lo Mein. It's like they just boiled the noodle and mix in some soy sauce. I was really looking forward to that wok smell. The bamboo did not have enough chilli oil. I thought the Sichuan beef and the beef tendon and the tofu dish were authentic because of the Sichuan peppercorn.","603":"First time here at D'lites. I had the chocolate pretzel ice cream and my daughter had the title cheesecake ice cream. They were both very good. Flavors weren't very distinguishable but tasty in their own right. It was really just as good as many other soft serve ice creams i have had and at only 50 calories a serving and no sugar, I was impressed. There was a fun toy ice cream stand for my daughter to play with and a chalk board wall with chalk for her to draw on.  All in all a great no guilt treat, especially for the summertime. I'll be going back :)","604":"Best lamb tips and BBQ sausage. Pizza is best around. It's a dive. But worth going to.","605":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, beautiful desserts. If you like Ethiopian food or want to try it, go here. :)","606":"Delicious and nutritious!  Came here late Tuesday night and ordered the ceviche chalupa. Party in my mouth, seriously!  The chalupa stayed crunchy even though I dumped the whole side of salsa that it came with on it.  I loved how it was made. They did not skimp out on the ingredients.  I was full after one! I also had the black tea which was perfect on a TX summer night.  For the price, quality, and really the most important thing--the taste, I'm sold!   Bufalo Bob, I'll be back!","607":"Great atmosphere. The staff is excellent and they have a deep knowledge of wine and food. It's a great place for special occasions and we saw several birthdays being celebrated. The food was good, but a few items were a bit bland for my taste. Be in no rush and bring several dollars, it isn't cheap nor would you expect it to be.","608":"My visit from Vancouver, BC, was definitely worth the trip!!  Can't wait to drive back and try out the new gym when it opens across the river.","609":"I just bought three bar chairs from here, and my sales rep, Ryan, was extremely friendly and professional. Great price and service.","610":"Awesome family restaurant. The chicken and jellyfish salad with Chinese radish, cucumbers and carrots is SO tasty and perfect for the summer!! Also their Kung Pao chicken (diced chicken with chilies and peanuts) is the best I've ever had in Vancouver. Hits the spot.","611":"I've never taken to social media to review before now. The Salem, MA location has terrible customer service. I'm livid with my treatment. A few days ago, my order was over an hour late, arrived cold and the driver forgot the receipt. For my trouble,  I was told that my next order would be free. I just phoned to take them up on that, and I was told there was no credit in their system for me. I am too failed by this location. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business. SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY! Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable. A free side order? Not good enough! I'm a disabled,  housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today. I've never experienced such deplorable service from Domino's. I've been a loyal customer for over 20 years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts.  I'll never do business with you again. I'm writing corporate as well. I don't taken being mistreated well. It's unacceptable!","612":"Don't waste your money or time with this place. I been a member since 2014,  at the Hillsboro location and had amazing Brenda work on my facials. I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.\n I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY here.","613":"I went to Bob's on Friday for some take out with my friends. \n\nI walked inside and immediately noticed the small market charm along with a rich aroma of Italian food. \n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful. I ordered a jumbo chicken cutlet parm sandwich. The bread was soft and warm....it was also filled with a generous portion of meat, cheese, sauce etc. at an extremely low price. Overall.....delicious.\n\nI wish I could give 4 1\/2 stars instead of 4, but the only complaint I have that Bob's has a very small bakery selection. If ownership ever looks to expand, I would suggest having a full bakery counter with all sorts of Italian pastries. This would make Bob's untouchable!","614":"I don't know a lot about bubble tea but I know I love what they are sellin' to be at Bubble World!\n\nThe prices are quite decent for bubble tea and I am not addicted to the Milky Mango Ice Cream Slush! It's like a milkshake with a super sweet fruity flavor, drools!\n\nThis location serves up food and apparently a lot of bad rap music. They have a decent amount of seating but it is almost always full, I find it too loud in there but it's perfect for grabbing a delicious beverage to go!","615":"Food was great.  The pepper chicken is the best.  This place is neat and clean.  The staf  are sweet.  I recomend them to anyone !!","616":"I always get Pad See Ew or the Pho and it is great the owner also lets me know he does not use MSG which is a plus! Though it is in a obscure location If you are traveling in Atlanta and know about this place it is a hidden gem with good service I would recomment it!","617":"There are tons of froyo places in Austin, but this one is definitely noteworthy. The texture of the yogurt is perfect and the flavors are pretty diverse. They are pretty good about rotating flavors, but makes sure to keep the classics. They also do seasonal flavors which is really nice and during Christmas time introduced different flavors every week or so. I thought it was a nice touch to keep things different and add a little flare. It also kept me wanting to come back each time to try the new flavors! Toppings are also nice and fresh. The sizes are great, which I only point out after visiting another place and wishing I could cut the toppings in a quarter of their size. They also have a rewards program that gives you a few free ounces almost every other time you visit. It's worth looking into - the program even has an app!","618":"My friends and I were in town at Universal and wanted to skip the chain restaurants and Theme Park food...we decided to try this place out and were not disappointed. Authentic Mexican food and friendly homey environment. Will definitely be back our next trip to Orlando.","619":"Food was pretty crappy and service was very very slow on a night that was ~75% capacity. I understand some nights are busy but you gotta come by my table more often than every 30 mins.","620":"Will never go back to any toys r us. I'm not sure how this this location is still in business. Every time I shop here I leave wishing I never walked in. The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.  I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store. This place suxs the life out of you!","621":"Just call her angel of the hemming, AN-GEL\nJust take in my dress before I leave, BA-BY.\nJust call her angel of the hemming, AN-GEL\nthen slowly turn away from me.\n\nOk, maybe she wasn't Chip Taylor's inspiration for Angel of the Morning, but I still get that song stuck in my head every time I drop stuff off to be altered.  Great service and great quality!  I have been coming here for a few years now, and have never been disappointed.  The owner is very warm and friendly and her prices are extremely reasonable.  She specializes in weddings and quinceaneras, and can do anything from intricate formalwear to hemming a pair of pants.  Every time I come in, I feel like I'm talking to a long lost friend.","622":"Michael and company are fantastic! All the beer is tasty and fair prices on everything. All the comments on here about the hours and dogs. It's a functioning brewery first and foremost run mainly by Michael and his wife so the hours reflect that. I know some want to tear it up into the wee hours, but this place is what it is a brewery. And the rules about dogs aren't the owners rules they are the states so if you have an issue with that take it up with your state legislature.","623":"WTH ... I actually wanted to say 'F' instead of 'H' ... Service is decent and ya their menu is awful except for soups ..... \nIt's overrated ...","624":"Nice pub ambience, on the small side with just a few seats at the actual bar itself.  Comfortable booths, several tables and chairs.  We arrived at around 1:30 on drizzly Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of seating available, so we grabbed a booth.\n\nInstantly attended to and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  I don't know what probs other reviewers had, but we had none.  \n\nWe enjoyed the Proletariat Red, simply delicious and not too hoppy, not too sweet...just riiiiiight.   \n\nI had the chicken ciabatta club sandwich and Mother Mary was it delicious!  Thick salty bacon, freshly grilled & slightly smoky chicken breast, sliced red onion and all the fixings on a warm and chewy ciabatta roll - which was a carb lover's wet dream.   Chose the tomato soup (oh how I wanted those fries but alas, the starchy carbs of the ciabatta roll cancelled those out)....\n\nMy compadre enjoyed a Blue Cheese burger or something of that sort.  Had mushrooms and crumbled bleau cheese on his beef.     I know he thoroughly enjoyed it  because he had visible and audible Foodgasms -  moaned and groaned through his entire meal.   He then emailed me later to tell me how fantastic his food was and can we please go back there soon!?\n\nIf you're ambling around Westmoreland\/Sellwood (this is not technically Sellwood - but whatever)  and you're hungry, stop in here for sure.  Great little neighborhood pub!","625":"Always suspicious of getting royally screwed when it comes to household repair calls, but this company is perhaps the best we have ever dealt with.  Courteous phone staff who take the calls and promptly get a repairman out and the repairman was so great.  He quickly analyzed the problem with our dryer and soon had the part in and we were up and running with a reasonable service fee.  Couldn't recommend this company enough.  Big 5 stars.","626":"Went here Monday with a Gilt city deal and ended up trying a whole lot more! The oysters and bottle of muscadet which was the deal were delightful. Next we ordered the plateau which was nothing short of magical and oustanding. The ceviche was on point, perfect level of acidity with sweet peppers and gorgeous fresh fish. Not a fan of the littleneck clams but that's just a personal preference, however, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, a classic and a goodie. The dressed lobster with loads of fresh herbs was heavenly and the char-grilled octopus with green chili's and blistered snow peas I could probably eat for the rest of my life. The octopus was so tender and rich and the peas and peppers added a necessary brightness that elevated the entire dish. The service was fantastic, very friendly, welcoming, quick and knowledgeable about the menu. No complaints about the automatically added 20% tip. If you don't like it, don't go out to eat! We would gladly return!","627":"Best sushi place. Been a regular for years. Highly recommend the Chicken Kaarage Bowl","628":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. I love the pho and the vermicelli bowls. I've tried many other places and none compare.","629":"Worth a visit just for  the unparalleled view of Portland!\n$10\/adult, you can do a self guided tour or have a guide. We didn't have much time so we went self-guided, the tidbits I overheard from a guide wee very interesting and added to the experience so I suggest doing a guided tour. \nBe sure to stop by the rose garden near here as well.","630":"Whenever I fly into Portland, I take the earliest flight and drive straight to the Tin Shed. \n\nDelicious Blood Marys and very good food. Anything I've ordered has not disappointed.","631":"It's a chain that tries to be neighborhood-y.\nIt's okay, but my preference is to go to a real neighborhood-y place.\nHaving said all of that, it was pretty good.  In the Prado, this has an outdoor area that we used (I am part of the GW alumni network here in Atlanta).  You're kind of on display for everyone walking by, if you're okay with that.\nWe had standard bar food and it was fine - humus, fries, shrimp, etc.\n\nNote: the restrooms are like the ones at One Midtown Kitchen.  Unless you notice and know that the red lights on or off outside of them means that they are occupied, you will yank on the door and try to open locked doors (and probably have the user nervously clench inside).","632":"Extremely unprofessional! I came in to upgrade my phone. They did not have the phone I wanted even though it is one of the most popular phones. They said they would have to get it from another store. The employees left me sitting there for over 30 minutes while they joked back and forth with each other. Supposedly they were doing something with my account but did not communicate with me at all. They could not locate my account even though I have a Fido number and online account. I finally left the store as parking was expiring. Go to a real Fido store as previous reviewer suggests.","633":"\"We'll cross that bridge when we get there.\" But what if we need to cross a bridge just to get there? I'd cross a mountain to get to Sapporo. \n\nMomofuku and Baohaus have ruined Pork Buns for me, and I never thought I'd find decent ones in Boston. But at $5.50 for two, Sapporo's are a steal. And better than decent. Done deal.\nMiso has never been my favorite, but the Spicy Miso Ramen gives me a run for my money. Soft, dense grains of the white stuff glide down your throat, and if you add a red-hot kick of chili, you really start to taste the spicy ground pork. Yum.\nI've had no broth more perfect than the Kimchee Ramen with its chewy al dente noodles. The kimchee packs some punch, and an addition of spicy ground pork is just perfect.\n\nI never want to go to Porter Square, but it takes about the same amount of time to get to as Allston's Super 88, the only food court that rival the Shops so if you say Sapporo I'll come running. So keep up the good work Sapporo, I think you also put Lesley University on the map.","634":"Probably one of my favorite places, I loved the brunch so so good, the service was really good too, their bloody Mary's- amazing :) I had the Brie sandwich and means my friends shared the dynamite roll and the ahi poke as appetizers and it was delish!\nHighly recommend","635":"Kinda a pretentious strange dive bar. Full of lots of office jocks, and scantly clad plastic looking, women, good beer selection, good happy hour, terrible terrible food. \nPlease do yourself a favor a skip eating here. Wings were just bones no meat at all. Seems like they were over fried and re fried. Slow cooked chicken was just Safeway roasted chicken with some day old bread toasted. In no way what so ever worth $16, a complete waste of money, no quality check. \n\nServer was running around like a mad person, not really doing anything, then she would disappear for 20min at a time.  I'm not really sure what was going on with her. Then she was pissy when when we were ordering from the bar.\n\nDecent live music a bit to loud for the time. Emptied pretty quick once the musician started. He was good just to loud.","636":"Yes, it can be pricey.  However, if you watch the store flyer it actually has some pretty good sales (especially on coffee beans and seasonal fresh fruits).  \n\nThe store has a nice bulk bin selection for nuts, dried fruit, snacks, and candy.  I am addicted to the flax-infused corn chips.  As a gourmet store, you will find interesting goods and high-quality produce.\n\nThe deli and cheese counter offer a wide array of delicious goods.  Always make sure to ask for a sample taste before buying.  The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nAnd for any potential shoplifters, be warned -- they do watch you.  On my last visit, the police were removing a cuffed offender from the store ;-)","637":"Went there this morning expecting good things. Terrible under-cooked food(twice we sent it back)  not a good experience.  We ordered Ham and got some space age meat like substance. Never again.","638":"This place is the best kept secret!  Do NOT try to do this at the Post Office.  The people here are super helpful and I literally didn't even sit down.  A huge thanks to the workers here.  Everyone is friendly and they do it with a smile.","639":"We ended up here as sort of a company \"after-party\".  We had a great time.  The outside ambiance was really nice (although pretty dusty\/dirty).  We had fun playing ping-pong and drinking.  The bartender was really nice and she had beers cracked and drinks poured amazingly fast.  Very cool place to sweat and drink.","640":"Came by today and it was closed. Hope she goes out of business because she is bad for the other black businesses in the community. All she does is try and get other black businesses in the area closed instead of capitalizing off of it.  She is a low down evil miserable individual.","641":"This shop embodies what I love about Austin.  In one word:  original.  There is a pleasant variety of very unique items.  I've purchased jewelry, candles, cards and even a stuffed cat (not real) for my son.  Three cheers for Take Heart!","642":"Definitely the best Indian food in town. I'm not used to Indian food costing more than $20 so the prices were quite shocking. I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\n\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \n\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \n\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!","643":"Probably one the best patio restaurant's in Atlanta. All of the gays and lesbians come out and drink til they are merry on this perfect patio in midtown; but don't let that deter you if you are straight, it is an equal mix of people, believe me! The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning. The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!!\n\nThe beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5. There is regularly trivia, and there is always some reason to stop by Joe's. During the warm months, it is very hard not to just say, \"why don't we meet at Joe's?\", because it is the place to be. Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay. This is definitely a place that you will want to check out, for it's chilled atmosphere, the welcoming flair, and well, the whole package! You are bound to see me there, as we love to go to Joe's!","644":"I went here some time back and did not find much 'resistance' to anything Establishment by the main guy here.   In fact, I found the views about the US made 'drug war' in Colombia seemed almost to parallel that of the US government.     It really was totally disappointing.     The place definitely is not the center of any sort of  rebellion\/ political resistance that I could see.","645":"Chill spot.  Lax atmosphere.  It gets smokey...","646":"Best in Boston is right! I love Le's. \n\nCheap pho (around $7\/bowl) and such a great, chill environment. Service is spot on and super accommodating.The best part is that the pho comes out ridiculously fast. The broth is SO yummy and gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy. Generous amount of tripe and meat!\n\nThe #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl. If you have the appetite of a small bear like he does, I think coughing up an extra dollar for the extra big bowl is worth it.","647":"My girlfriends and I didn't go back to this restaurant after they renovated.  I found negative comments more than positive on other sites review.\n\nWe made the rsvn at 12.30pm and waited for few mins then got seated.  I found they have quite a lot of dim sims but absolutely overpriced!!  S-3.68, M-4.38, L-5.38, SK-6.38, SLK-7.98, SKK-8.98.  You may only find 1-2 items are $3.68 and most of items are $5.38 even more.\n\nDeep fried Chicken knees w\/wasabi - it's so greasy and the wasabi looked like so artificial coz fluorescence color.\n\nSteamed Black truffle mushroom dumpling - Only mixed mushroom dumplings, there is NO black truffle mushroom inside.\n\nSteamed salted egg yolk custard bun- Buns were so big and egg yolk was bland.\n\nBeef tripe and tender pot - It didn't look good but taste good.\n\nSteamed beef balls - Very soft and probably marinated with baking power!!\n\nShort ribs and pork liver rice roll pot - Super greasy!!!  I only had a rice roll and it's oily!\n\nThis is regular dim sum place, such quality of food and poor service.  I will not recommend this place at all.","648":"Great cold brew iced coffee and tasty donuts.  The staff is very friendly and the expanded location is excellent for a quick bite or even a decent sit","649":"Better than Voodoo. THERE I SAID IT.\n\nAs an Austinite I know I am expected to like Voodoo because of their location in Austin but they seem too gimmicky in my honest opinion. Blue Star is more subdued but still comes up with inventive flavors that do not have me thinking \"what the hell did I just eat.\"\n\nGreat donuts, even greater line.","650":"This cafe is typically my last resort when eating breakfast downtown. I like that they serve local organic food. The service is always great. Their food is always underwhelming. I've eaten here 5 times in the last year. It's consistent in the experience.","651":"Received a box of assorted chocolates for Christmas.  Absolutely delicious, especially the coconut items and the truffles.\n\nOrdering again for myself.","652":"Overall not bad, service was great. Luggage assistance is helpful, (Alan from Venezuela was super nice) they even had our luggage delivered to our room from Caribbean Beach! ... My only complain is the gnats.\n\nStayed here for 2 nights in room 3233 - 50's section. We switched over from Caribbean Beach Resort to save some money. I suggest not booking a water view room - you will get gnats outside of your room that will get into your room. Be prepared to swim through a swarm of gnats getting to your room. We had some in our showers and the corners of the ceilings. To remedy this we lowered the temperature of the room since they do not like warm temperatures. But gnats are mostly harmless so we decided to keep our room. Overall, the room was clean (bed was made every night, new towels, new toiletries).","653":"It was my birthday so I wanted to do a date night with my husband. I am a child of the 80s and heard about this place and was eager to try it out.\nHubby and I arrived early, after reading reviews about waiting for spots to play these retro arcade games. We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches. For my birthday I was brought back to a decade I enjoyed thoroughly!!","654":"The positive: large restaurant right in the Tuttle Crossing mall. Decor is very cool, and restaurant was clean. Food was delivered piping hot. \nThe negative: service was exceptionally slow. Our server left a lot to be desired. It took her over 5 minutes to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came, and we were all ready to order, and indicated that to her. She just smiled  and walked away. Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware. We had to flag down a different server and ask her to get our server so we could get utensils. \nWhen she finally brought them she took our food order. \nThen we waited...and waited.... and waited.... 45 minutes before our food arrived. The restaurant wasn't all that busy. Other tables that arrived after us actually finished eating before we even got our food!\nWe ate very fast as we had to be somewhere at a certain time. Paid our bill via the ziosk. She came to clear our plates and we asked for a to go box. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring a to go box. We wound up being late for our activity due to slow service.\nAdvice: go there if you want got food and have a few hours to kill waiting for slow service","655":"We used ADBF to board our very hyper German Shorthaired Pointer, while we went to the East coast, two weeks before Christmas. He had a wonderful time, and came back all in one piece, with little energy to spare. I have taken him to a places before, where we got him back with a staph infection and many other issues. Everyone here is welcoming during drop offs and pick ups, and they are great when you call to check up on your dog. Huck Loves all of the staff, and other dogs. We will use ADBF for all other boarding needs!!","656":"Awful service.. slow!.. couldn't get refills like asked.. feel we were ignored!\nWon't go back to this location..\nGarlic butter fries were dry","657":"These people are the best.  I don't know anything about plumbing, and I had an unusual plumbing problem at work that had to be fixed asap.  The guy was able to come up with a solution, and actually assembled the parts for me, so all I had to do at work was screw the whole assembly onto the pipe.  Then he didn't even charge me for the adhesives or for his time.  It was amazing.  I'm definitely going back if I have any plumbing trouble in the future.","658":"This place was not worth it, the tortillas were paper like and hard to pull apart, the crispy taco shells were out of a box. There was no flavor, lots of reviews keep referring to price but if its not worth eating its not worth buying.","659":"Bought a deal online for 5 classes.  I have been taking similar classes at a Lexington studio.  Apparently, Jody owns both studios.  These classes are amazing!  They are challenging and go by quickly.  My body has changed drastically, taking this type of pilates once a week for the past couple of months.","660":"This is one of, I think, 4 full service bars in the Austin Airport. It used to have a wider draft beer selection but now it's just Bud Light and Miller Light (yikes).\n\nFor better draft beer go all the way across the airport down by United.\n\nThe sandwiches are also pretty bad, like the burger. Better off going to Thundercloud.\n\nBut I was there in late December and there were people with Airport contractor badges being shown around and being told \"it's always packed\" at such and such times. because it's right next to the Delta gates, which operate the largest planes to Austin (757).\n\nSo maybe it will be changing soon.","661":"Waited over 30 minutes for my free birthday pizza on July 29th, 2016 in the afternoon after getting salad and soda. I saw a small cardboard box sitting on an inactive heating tray. I said it must be mine and got it. Angry that no one said my name at all while waiting all that time and left with my full bags.","662":"Spectacular, one of a kind restaurant with an elegant, serene atmosphere. They have the best deals during September, as you can order the Magical Dining all you can eat option for about half off the original price. One of my favorite places for exquisitely made steak and simple but delicious desserts.","663":"There are not that many places where you can dig in with your hands and some tools of shellfish distruction around the city.  Although this place is pricy, it brings back a piece of home where my family would sit around and pick at crab legs while we talked for hours.  \n\nWe've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out.  \n\nOld Bay Crawfish: 1  1\/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w\/ old bay. served w\/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  \n\nMixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w\/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  \n\nI've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.  Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to.","664":"We made reservations over a week ago for a special occasion, we had heard negative comments but wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow. Dinner was very bland, no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat. After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else. Be smart and read the reviews, this place is just not worth your time or money.","665":"The service we received was absolutely fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful for my 11yo daughter who is very picky.","666":"Oh wow, yum.\n\nI went there last night and will definitely go back.  The ingredients taste so fresh and flavorful.  The place is really cute.  My only gripe and the reason for giving it four stars is the waitress service was lacking.  It took quite a while to flag someone down and I finally got one of the bus boys to take my order.  (I was starved!)\n\nIt seems they have a buffet.  I'll be back to try that one day.  At $13, it's the same price as most of the entrees and a great option for the indecisive like me.","667":"I visited the Sam Adams brewery during a trip to Boston in September 2008.  It was much more intimate than I expected, as it is one of the largest breweries in the US.  It turns out that this is the original location, but more of an R&D facility currently.\n\nWe had to wait around a bit for the next tour, but it wasn't too long.  I was quite surprised to learn that Sam Adams was founded in 1984 (I would have guessed 1884, if those were my two options).  The tastings were good and we even got to sample a couple of new brews they were testing.  \n\nI haven't been to Harpoon, so I can't compare, but plan to check it out the next time I'm in Boston.","668":"I went well out of my way to try the sushi here. Upon arriving, I quickly regretted it. The guy preparing sushi behind the counter was sniffing constantly. It was gross and made me concerned that someone sick was preparing my food. \n\nAgainst my better judgement, I ordered the pineapple roll. I was sadly disappointed. It had an unappetizing crunch to it, and it was small for the price.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was friendly, but not enough to make up for the food or ambience of the place.","669":"I have been to Capital City when my regular mechanic is not available. They have fixed my head lamp, at no charge! turns out it was just unhooked (they said that sometimes happens with these Volvo's) They could have easily charged me for a new bulb, but they didn't. Their great customer service will definitely bring me back. That is what I love about my neighborhood shop. They are honest and friendly and will get the job done fast =-)","670":"I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\n\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w\/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\n\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b\/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.","671":"Went to Bosphorous 2 weeks ago with my sisters for lunch. I was actually looking forward to it because it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in park avenue. As usual, we ordered humus and bread. Since we were sharing, I wanted to scoop some humus and put it in my plate. As I was doing that I noticed hair, as it was inside the humus. I immediately put my fork down and waited for a waiter. He was new so his trainer deeply scrutinized the plate in front of us, not believing. He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would shed. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I didn't like the demeaning nature of this manager. I felt like he treated us like this because we were young because I'm pretty sure if we were older and looked different m, he wouldn't have all these excuses. \nWe ate our dinner, which was good and left. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon, if ever.","672":"Got my tires swapped a few weeks ago a and they were very friendly and nice. Went shopping right after and noticed the tpms light went off and gave them a call and asked about it and they told me to swing by and that they would check it out. Even though they were busy they still were able to check on my car. Very satisfied! Thanks again!","673":"Their chile relleno en crema is one of Austin's best meals.  It's also one of the few places in town where you can get real interior Mexican food -- pepian sauces, ancho chile sauces, and deeply rich moles. I'm pretty indifferent to the atmosphere but the food is outstanding.","674":"Thank you yelp, in the ATL for a day and we were looking for great chicken and waffles.  Took your advice and found the great unassuming little restaurant in a strip center that was absolutely #fantastic.  The Chicken and Bacon Cheddar Waffles was perfect,  perfect moist fried chicken and the waffle was just great.  We also ordered the southern breakfast and again ---- just perfect.  I consider myself a grits snob and these did not disappoint.  Creamy, no clumps and when I cut those fried eggs in, #omg.  #justsayin. On my next trip to Atlanta I will definitely return.","675":"This place is for coffee geeks. Coffee was excellent. The selection of snacks\/pastries was fairly limited, to a couple of scones and cookies, perhaps because we were there late in the day around 5. Non-coffee drink selection for kids seemed to be limited to hot cocoa. Nice small space though for sitting around having coffee.","676":"I was super excited to finally find a place serving california burritos. This place unfortunately did not really deliver what I was seeking; in all the wrong places.\n\nInstead of delicious carne asada it is way too greasy, instead of lots of crunchy fries it is soggy and greasy, way too little guac or pico.\n\nI will have to wait until next time Im in SD for the real thing, oh well at least they tried.","677":"Where's the kimchi, Taco Box?\n\nI'd been wanting to try this bright yellow food truck for some time, especially given its tempting location in a gas station parking lot. I finally gave in on a Friday night, and as I was the only one there I thought it would be the perfect time for somebody to rob me at gunpoint.\n\nI got the Spicy Pork Taco Box. It's a huge taco accompanied by lots of noshes including iceberg lettuce in orange dressing, spicy wings, a mystery egg thing and two mystery fried things. The taco was merely OK, the wings set my lips ablaze, and the mystery fried balls in mystery sauce were amazing. Sadly, there was no kimchi.\n\nThis is a better option than Taco Bell, but hardly a destination.","678":"Hit this up with a group of friends and it was awesome.  Good beef, good pork and a pretty solid mushroom burger coming from someone who doesn't usually dig on that hippy nonsense.  The fries are cooked perfectly and they are rocking truffle salt.  Truffle salt!!!  Good call.  Also, I think they make the fries out of Yukon Gold potatoes which is always the way to go.  Can't wait to be back to try out some more bridges.","679":"Got my hair bleached and dyed for the first time here. I was really nervous at first because I had never bleached my hair before, but the staff were exceptionally helpful and explained all the pros and cons to allow me to make my choice. In the end, I still wanted to dye my hair pearl white. Note that I have black, Korean hair about as dark as it gets. I ended up bleaching my hair three times before dying it and it looks amazing! This was done 2 weeks ago and it surprisingly still looks super good. My hair doesn't feel damaged and I get complements for it all the time. Oh, and the cut? In my books, they are specialists when it comes to asymmetric cuts. I would highly recommend this hair studio and especially Han.","680":"Really great pizza quality and toppings options. The crust is thin, light colored, and soft with dark, charred spots that tastes like it was baked in a very hot oven. The atmosphere is also really nice- our waitress was great as well. The reason for 4 stars, not 5, is because my salad wasn't too great. I just got the house salad and found it really oily and sweet. I also noticed other tables got bread to munch on before their food came, but we didn't get any","681":"So we decided to stop in to have a bite. And we made a wonderful discovery here. The Pizza was some of the BEST in town. Service was amazing and I think the waitress was named Mia? Location is E. Broad st. She was very sweet & keep us happy. Also we had drinks & more food & Desert YUM!!! We will be coming back for more and talked about trying the Lunch menu as well. \nLetting ppl know how great our 1st time was. Keep up the great work !!!","682":"If I could give this place a negative star rating, I would. After my girlfriend got patted down before walking in, we sat down to have a couple of drinks at the bar. Once we got our drinks, the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down, not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything, etc. I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check. From there, it went further downhill...My legal name is William, but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William...like Joe for Joseph, or Bob for Robert, Dick for Richard, etc. Well, they wouldn't accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill. In all my years, I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected...and I mean never!! I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX. After all that, I just ended up paying cash, but this was in my mind terrible customer service! The place inside leaves a lot to be desired as well....small, unclean bathroom, etc. I would not recommend this place to anyone...there are much better places to go in that same vicinity.","683":"I realize this place has good reviews, but I was not at all impressed.  One Dr. there is nice and the other is not so nice.  I was hoping to have the nicer Dr. but kept getting the other one and it was highly frustrating.  It is weird to not have any privacy and be out in the open with other people staring at you.  It seemed that regardless of what the complaint was, the Dr. would do the same exact procedure on everyone.  That can't be right.  If I had a neck complaint, he would do the same song and dance as someone that had a lower-back complaint.  I noticed this and thought it was strange.   I found it unnerving to have to have adjustments done while other people stared at me, but that's the nature of this open environment.  Just not my cup of tea.","684":"Stopped in here to try the new Gluten Free bun with a grilled chicken sandwich last Thursday. The GF bun was a little small  and dry and tasted just okay. The bun did crumble apart as I ate my grilled chicken sandwich. This is somewhat typical of GF breads. My fries were lukewarm. The store was clean and service was quick and friendly, so I'll be back to try the GF bun again when I'm in the area.","685":"The food here is amazing and well priced. The chef specials are always great. I love the Tom ka and the thai tea is my favorite drink ever. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants ever. A must try place in Louisville. Once you do, you'll keep coming back!","686":"Tiny little bar, but I understand there is an upstairs that has never been open when I have been a patron. I typically frequent bars\/restaurants on a Monday night, as I am a chef myself. \n\nHands down, best chicken wings in Boston. Monday they are 25 cent wings, lucky for me it's the day I always go. Meaty and juicy with a handful of different flavors. Also, they have a a 7 dollar coors light pitcher. You tell me where else in Boston you can get that! I'm still looking. \n\nMy only gripe is that the jukebox has been out of service for the past 6 months since I discovered this joint. \n\nAll in all, it's a nice little bar nestled on cobblestone streets between TD Banknorth Arena and the Italian North End. Definately worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for a snack and some cheap beer.","687":"The server told us they won the Best New Downtown Restaurant Of 2017. Some delicious, gourmet-portion dishes. \n\nTheir hospitality was disappointing as we made reservations the night before for 8pm on a Tuesday and when we arrived the female server said our table wasn't ready and if we left and came back in 20 minutes she'd be able to push 2 small tables for our group of 4. She didn't seem apologetic at all.\n\nA male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table.\n\nWe discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere.\n\nThe server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back.\n\nIn terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction.\n\n$33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4\/5.\n\n$23 Duck and Anchovy Ragu, Lemon and Parsley was good.\n\n$4 House Bread and Butter, $19 Mixed Salami Plate and $23 Tagliatelle, Bolognese was okay but no different than anywhere else.\n\n$24 Nettle Risotto, Pecorino & Shaved Almonds was a 3 out of 5.\n\nAgain, some tasty dishes but tiny portions. The noise was also slightly too loud to the point that you'd have to ask your neighbor to repeat themselves. We still had a great time despite the reservation issue and unthoughtful service. There were 2 dishes the server cleared without asking if we were done. They only had a bite or two on there but these are gourmet portions girl! That's like a third of the dish! \n\nBill for 4 people that were still hungry after was $292.50 before tip.","688":"My favorite place now in Beverly for casual dining.  The food is plentiful, attractively priced, and damn good. Surprisingly varied menu. The ambiance isn't overly sophisticated but is quite acceptable. \n\nThis place usually is not overcrowded: on some nights, though, there is live entertainment, so if you don't easily handle noise\/increased din, get out by 9:00pm.\n\nFull bar and full wait staff service.  Turnaround time for food orders is not too long.  Way above-average pub experience.  Great value, friendly staff.","689":"What an awesome cool place!!!! Best grilled cheese ever. Had the crisp buffalo and my husband had the  melt. It's whim delight and nostalgia on a plate... must come!!!","690":"Rigatone and Steak.  That's all I have to say!!!! This place has some of the best food I've tasted in Boston!","691":"Over the years, I've had a burger here before and always thought it was good.  Recently, I set up a corporate outing here with over 100 people.  The appetizers were ok, but the entrees on the buffet were lousy.  Just before the dessert went out, someone pointed out a cockroach walking on the plates to me, DISGUSTING.  See picture.  They also \"didn't receive\" our first check, then they charged over $10k on our credit card without authorization.  We tried to sort this out, they told us to send another check and when they received it, they will credit our card.  Well, they cashed the check over a month ago and still no refund to us.  I will NEVER go here again and I will tell everyone I know not to as well.","692":"Never again !!!\nFound a dead bug in a dish from the buffet!!\nWhen I showed it to the staff, the response was just a sheepish grin, no apology or anything.\nThey just don't care for the quality or health of customers.","693":"Delicious low key spot. Enjoyed sat brunch. Had hash with egg, black cod fishermans stew abd orrechiette- all tasty. Sangria was a little bitter and served withiut fruit. Friendly service and cute atmosphere. Single bathroom so plan to wait. Would like to try for dinner since lunch is brunch menu.","694":"Super awkward experience at front counter. The female employee seemed to complain once asked to do dishes or something, saying \"This will be the SIXTH time, SIXTH!\" Then she made my drink. \n\nI was sort of weirded out that she was having this conversation while I was standing paying for my drink, but blew it off. Then I got my americano and it's so bad! Disappointing on all fronts compared to previous experiences. Maybe this employee was having an off day, but I just wanted a delicious espresso.","695":"This is hands down my favorite pizza place in central Florida. \nAfter a recent trip to NYC I can vouch that A Touch of Basil is just as delicious and any of the shops I tried while there. Love it!","696":"Well if you are looking for a quiet dinner where you can talk to your family this is not the place for you. There is a party atmosphere is the restaurant in the evening. A DJ, dancers, and music fill the room with all kinds of eye candy that is lots of fun but in some ways takes away from your dining experience. While it is fun to get people dancing on table tops and throw cocktail napkins in the air at any given moment, getting your food on time is not as easy as it seems. After seating, it took nearly ten minutes to get an order of drinks. Another ten-fifteen minutes to get our order of food in and the time between seeing our waiter kept adding up. The food was good however, was not plentiful. A steak kabob wasn't on a skewer and only came with one grouping of meat\/vegetables. Bottom line, if you want to drink and have a good time at a bar type place the. Head here in the evening for appetizers and cocktails but if you are looking for a good dinner and conversation go someplace else.","697":"They're pizza is great, authentic thin crust with fresh toppings.  They should be charging more then $2 a slice. Plus the staff is really nice.","698":"I am in love with this store!! Dropped in for a quick ring size and Joe was very courteous and designs some amazing pieces. I'm planning on going back with some stones and see what kind of explosion of creative genius can happen.\nAlso... If you need custom yard art, this is certainly a place to check out as well!!","699":"Hair snobs unite! This is the best place I know of in Harvard Square.","700":"I'm on the fence with Teela Taqueria.  I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?).","701":"We liked it when we went for dinner. So we went for buffet. Not much choice for vegetarians. Biryani has gone bad and not so good curries for naans. So we could not have biryaniz and breadz even though buffet was very expensive!","702":"If you like overpriced furniture and pushy sales staff, this is the place to go!\n\nI don't, so took my business elsewhere. \n\nAt least they did me a favor and let me know that they were scammers up front- among other things, every item I looked at was only going to be \"on sale\" for a few more days. Even the items that would be custom ordered.\n\nIf you're that awful before they take your money, just imagine what they're going to be like after the sale.","703":"I ordered the avocado Margarita that they are famous for. I was not disappointed. It was super creamy and they add just the right amount of alcohol that creeps up on you! :) I also ordered the tamales- also were very delicious.","704":"We stayed at the Burlington Marriott and ate at Summer Winter for dinner. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the lobster mac n cheese. We left so completely full and satisfied it was ridiculous. That was THEE best filet mignon I have ever had, hands down. It was seasoned perfectly, and cooked exactly at med rare as I requested. My husband raved about his mac n cheese, noting that they used a very tasty white cheese and the lobster was a large piece (1\/2 a lobster tail I believe) and very tender. It was a pricey dinner with drinks, but well worth it!!","705":"The entrees at Sakura can be hit or miss, but the appetizers and sushi are consistently good. If you like spicy food, the fire on fish maki is great. The egg rolls may be my wife's favorite appetizer in Wakefield.\n\nAs a bonus, the delivery is unreasonably fast, so this is a great option if you are too hungry to wait.","706":"This place is excellent and I'm glad we have it so close by in Clintonville. I have only been once so far. I had the thinly sliced flank steak w\/garlic and general tso's. Both dishes were the best I have had. Very fresh with a lot of veggies. I will definitely be back for more and to try the sushi and Thai dishes they offer.","707":"Super slow service...don't go here for lunch if you're on a timed break!","708":"Great HH and reverse HH everyday, and all day on Sundays (includes select sushi, appetizers, and sake). Sushi is high quality, recommend lobster roll appetizer, crazy roll, spicy yellowtail, and tuna. Seaweed salad and miso soup are cheap and tasty too.","709":"What a horrible experience coming by here all the way from dorchester! I made a appointment to come by here to check out a few honda accord sport sedan and 4x calling after back to back the vehicle has been SOLD and they called me last min everytime when i hop in my car to come and about to leave to come. So finally i visit and met the sale man name Victor and omG! I never met any one who got a grumpy face on him without a smile... not even tryna be greetful or nothing .. like dude ? Really im here to buy a car from YOU and ur not even happy as much ... and poor customer service! And Forgot to mention the sales manager look crZy too like ur not even happy or anything neither I just dont know... i mean if u have a bad day or something leave it behind and treat customer right u know... anyways showing me a vehicle that has dent back front side, paint chip off and all and tryna have me buy a car that i dont like like no!!! On top of that okay i come to check out a vehicle i havent seen in my life yes i admit its said black fabric seat but now im changing my mind to a leather seat what the F is the problem ?? After i said i kinda want leather seat cuz i want leather after test drive the accord with fabric i kinda dont like it so Salesman Victor goes \" oh if u know u made the appointment to see the vehicle like whats wrong with this that this that like hello dude I got $$$$$$ imma get wtf I want the heck u meannnn ??? Base on all I dont think this dealership is worth to have my $ sorry! \n\n0 star all da way!!","710":"Unos is actually my favorite restaurant and yet it's come to this--a two star review.  This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.","711":"Always a profound experience. The JFK100 exhibition was extraordinary. It included the speech he was to give on November 22, 1963 in Dallas as well as a portrait painted posthumously over what was initially an image of his brother Senator Edward M Kennedy.\n\nThe building itself is an outstanding example of architectural excellence.","712":"Animal Kingdom Lodge is a big beautiful hotel on the Disney property.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable, and the view of giraffes, zebras, and other exotic wildlife cannot be beat.  Jiko is maybe the best restaurant in disney world, and Boma had a great breakfast.  While Victoria Falls was great to grab a drink at.\nThe one problem I really have here is that it is a bit far from all the parks, except Animal Kingdom.  I have stayed here twice and enjoyed it both time very much, but I think my wife and I will try a different resort on our next trip.","713":"These people are extremely cheap and didn't deliver what I ordered via Teleflora. Consider me an experienced buyer who only wants the best for the people I send flowers too & I will never order from here nor Teleflora again.","714":"I'll start off by saying that four stars here is generous. But it is for two simple reasons, the view is absolutely gorgeous and the ambiance is far above that of the Oasis. If you want a sunset dinner or cocktails overlooking the lake, Soleil gets four stars.\n\nNow for the bad news. The food is only three stars. The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.\n\nWith that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic! Perfect choice for cocktails at sunset, and makes for a great date night.","715":"Service here is spectacular! \n\nOur family ate dinner here after an unsuccessful attempt to dine at Gracias Madre (their staff was out on a beach vacation...I WANT IN!). We were kind of bummed, but Tin Shed really brought our spirits up with their kindness, home-styled foods, and rustic vibes.\n\nIt was a cold night, and we were that annoying tourist family that requested to sit by the fireplace outdoors. They didn't have any indoor spots available. I loved the space. Our super sweet host told us that blankets were available should we need them--that's quality service in the ears of Californians. \n\nOur server was a tall down-to-earth boy who checked on us at the right times. We enjoyed some pints of local beer and literally licked clean all of our plates. Their food is veggie-friendly and there are options for everyone from burgers to salads. Tin Shed is also dog-friendly in the patio (and they offer dog desserts too!) and such a comfort-feel space. This place is a great place for family night or even for a chill date.","716":"After having all the usual stuff we eat on vacations (chicken tenders, burgers, pizza, etc) this was a refreshing meal.  The food was good, not out of this world good but good.  Their version of chicken tikka masala needs some help but what do you expect when it is not an Indian restaurant.  The dumplings were amazing as well as the other more traditional Asian dishes.  The service was Disney quality.  Our son had fallen asleep just a minute before we got to the restaurant.  Instead of inconveniencing us by having us take him out of the stroller, they switched our tables so that we can leave him in the stroller and have him resting tableside while we enjoyed our meal.","717":"We all loved the pizza. Wonderful flavor. Nice crust. The fettuccine Alfredo had way too much garlic for our liking (lots of chopped up garlic pieces!)  More than I had ever seen in a fettuccine Alfredo.  Won't order that again. Otherwise the portion size was nice. Too bad I threw most of it away.","718":"I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.","719":"Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.\n\nMy first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.\n\nOverall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports.","720":"No complaints on my side. This pub's 2 star review is undeserved and probably given by those who expect everything served on a silver platter. Understand that Texas industry abides by a different standard and you shouldn't expect fake smiles and an after meal foot massage from your server and you'll do fine here. \n\nMatthew and I started with a round of drinks: a corona and a bloody mary. Coronas will be coronas on good and bad days, but I was QUITE satisfied with my airport bloody. Strong, thick, & perfectly seasoned, it was just what I needed before catching a plane. \n\nWe ordered some sweet potato fries, a plate of wings, and the potato soup. For the price we payed, we got plenty of food that was well prepared, and the kitchen didn't skip out on plenty of cheese and bacon on my soup. \n\nOur server, Tony, was dope. For a young guy, he took care of all ten tables in the pub real well. \n\nWe're headed home, but if ever stuck in Austins airport again I wouldn't mind stopping in.","721":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant- we come here very often on the weekends! I love the enchiladas with beef and the Guacamole.  The service is always fast and the staff is excellent.  Side note: they are very family friendly, they always accommodate us and our baby in his car seat.","722":"At first my review was gonna be a mediocre 2 stars. However the service really saved them because I was honestly impressed. My friends and I were here to order drinks and apps, simple bites like chips and such. Our beers were fine, they were what you'd  expect. However when our duo chips (salsa and queso) came out, we were less than satisfied. The queso tasted extremely burned. Like as if it it was stewed a little too long, burned on the bottom and therefore permeated that burnt taste throughout. We told our server about it who stated that a few others had also complained about it. I happened to also order a fried chicken taco that was also served with queso...that also tasted burnt. In the end, I was impressed by how the manager and server approached the situation. We received a complimentary round of drinks which is the reason and multiple apologies. Mistakes happen, so it's how they handled the situation as to why my friends and I will be returning.","723":"Normally, not one for cupcakes, however, the organic carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and a double espresso was a great juxtaposition of bitter and sweet.  Not too many places open on Sunday evening in Cambridge, so this spot was a Sweet find.","724":"The Cart in the middle of DTC has good Burritos.\n\nI get the fajita wrap which with my specifications entails: rice, cheese, guac, salsa, hot sauce, steak, grilled onions and peppers and sour cream.  It is superb.  Not cheap for a street vendor (Large is $6.50 plus a buck or so for guac), but very good.","725":"Best coffee ever!  I love their half moon lattes. Great atmosphere, parking is a little tough.","726":"Today was my first time going to Whiplash and I will DEFINITELY be back!! Tameka the receptionist greeted me very promptly and offered me a bottle of water. Elise SLAYED my sew in and was sooooo FAST!!! She was also very professional and friendly! Excellent salon, the prices weren't extremely high and they sell hair so it's convenient also. \n\nUPDATE!! I went back to Whiplash and got some individual braids. I found out that Mika is actually the OWNER and not the receptionist (sorry Mika lol). Kim the braider did an AMAZING job on my hair. I've been receiving compliments literally since I left the salon. The customer service is impeccable and the stylists are very professional.","727":"I love ramen like a fat kid loves cake. I consider myself to be a ramen connoisseur of sorts. As far as flavor goes, Sapporo ramen is in the big leagues. The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot. There are a couple of things that bug though:\n\n1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the \"butter ramen,\" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded. That means you will have to share a table with someone, and this person or persons (it could be a whole family) will be sitting very very close to you. You will know about all their personal affairs by the time the meal is over.","728":"Cautionary tale: If you go to this establishment on a busy night, you may wait almost an hour and a half for your food--with no explanation, no contrition and no attempt at amelioration. That was our experience at Olivio.\n\nThe food\/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality\/portion size. The bread\/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long.\n\nThe waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit.\n\nWe understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself\/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating.\n\nI was here several years ago and now remember being underwhelmed at the food\/value, now we have more reasons not to return.","729":"This place gets \"nice neighborhood restaurant\" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I've had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  \n\nThe menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.  Rosebud is a good neighborhood restaurant and a viable options for all occasions.","730":"Literally not a thing, anything at all,  in my order was right but they gave me enough food to feed an African Village for at least a decade so I can't complain.  I ordered for me and  my brother I got enough food to feed all of Angola very pumped.  If it's midnight and you drive thru they'll hook you up with basically the whole menu from what I gather.   They did charge me an extra 2 bucks from what it said on the screen tho so 4\/5 stars.","731":"Good, authentic Taiwanese beef noodles. $10.75 per bowl. Costs an extra $1 for wide noodles.","732":"A cafe sister restaurant to the ever popular Chambar Restaurant, the owners are so smart. This place had a line waiting in front just for a table when we got there at noon, but luckily we only waited for about 10 minutes to get seated. I soon saw why as there's really only a few tables in the long narrow space.\n\nI like how the menu had a wide selection of breakfast selection, and the 3 of us each ordered a dish. \n\nI had this (straight from their online menu):\nSaumon Fume (served all day)\nOpen faced ciabatta sandwich. Fried egg, smoked salmon, caper cream cheese, sliced avocado, arrugula pepperdew and artichoke salad.\n\nIt was quite good! Cream cheese with the capers were a perfect pair, it would've been a bit healthier if there was less oil and salt. But overall, it was great. I would order that again.\n\nMy friends had:\n\nFricass\u0413\u00a9 (served all day)\n2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, arugula, applewood cheddar. Grilled foccacia.\n- She said it was quite good, served in a pan\n\nl'Omlette du Matin\nDaily selection of seasonal ingredients.\n- She said it was good as the beginning, but the flavours got too heavy and she couldn't even finish it.\n\nWould I come here again? Maybe not... one for lack of parking, two for long waits for a table, three for slightly high prices for just eggs\/salad\/tomato\/etc (but I guess they're in an $$$ location too). But hey, if you like that kind of stuff, check it out!","733":"This is possibly my favorite \"fast food chain\" per-say. Everything is amazing. The servers are always very nice are always willing to serve you more condiments if you ask for \"more\" of something. I especially love the the guacamole that they make at Chipotle. Although sometimes the servers don't fill up the whole container of you ask for it to be on the side or is completely fresh, it never fails to taste amazing. It's almost as good as guacamole in Mexico, but definitely the best in Oregon. It isn't a thick or watery consistency with the perfect size and amount of avocado chunks which makes it perfect.","734":"Wow.  Amazing hamburgers.   First visit.  Thanks yelpers for a correct review.   Had to try the prime time burger.  OMG delicious.   Poblano burger very good.  Sunrise burger delicious.  Classic burger so good.  Fries and sweet potato fries great.   Will definitely make plans to return next time we are in Austin.","735":"Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12\/09\/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.","736":"After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.","737":"Large, store with plenty of parking, seems to always be busy. Clean, organized, but not a lot of staff around. This store has the usual Target stuff...electronics, clothing, home, children's...and it also has food & pharmacy!","738":"Pretty good stuff. Had cold udon for the first time and it was awesome! Very small place, I been at UT for two years and I never saw this place on the drag. It is a must check out!!","739":"Mattresses...we all need them, but it can really be a pain to shop for them; seems like the mattress business attracts some hucksters to it. Notice all those 50% sales at the mattress stores? Umm hmm.\n\n\nAnyhow, the old mattress had been caving in for quite a while and she finally started to share my opinion that it was time for as new one (I think when you have to climb out of the bed rather than off of it, it's past time). There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress. Everything done exactly the way it was agreed to. Perfect.","740":"OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom.\n\nFirst, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar \/ pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\n\ngo Romer's!","741":"Not enough service-13 minutes sometimes for another train to come\nThree words: Braintree\/Ashmont split=Delays\nVery, very rude staff\n\nI.e.:\nWATCH THE DOORS!  THE DOORS WILL BE CLOSING!  WATCH THE DOORS! screeched at obnoxious volume, whereas service delays are made at a level no one can hear\n\nHave been called names by bus drivers in the good old days for being slow with putting in money and\/or scanning my pass (and I always have them out ahead of time)\n\nWould gladly pay more if they addressed their problems, but it all goes to debt reduction\n\n\nBut I do get reliably each day where I want to go and can read books while doing so","742":"I'm not a food trough kind of person, and prefer quality over quantity.  It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.\n\nThere are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.\n\nIf you're in the mood to shovel decent meat in your face once in a while, give HomeTown Buffet a try again.  I'm glad I did.","743":"I had been meaning to write a bad review of this place for a couple of months now. Looks like I'm too late, since they are closing at the end of the month. I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didn't have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26\" rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles). I've worked in a shop before, and customers are the lifeblood of the shop - bummer this guy didn't realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under.","744":"The queso we received for checking in was delicious, and the fajitas were pretty good. We went on a Saturday night, where it was super crowded and they were understaffed, so you could tell everyone was a little stressed. It was also a little much for a margarita that was just mediocre.","745":"My friend recommended me of this new place in town. This self-served frozen yogurt shop has a greatly optimistic attitude fit for Portland. I felt good the first time I walked in and saw a green-yellow themed decoration with a number of great quotations about life and laughter all over the place. We were greeted with a sample cup to taste all those wonderful flavors of frozen yogurt. There are so many flavors to choose. My favorite is Chocolate Cake a la Mode. They say they will change the flavor every week so it's a good reason to go back there again and again. The options for toppings were even more fabulous - ranging from chocolate fudge to chocolate chip pieces to fresh fruit. I totally love this place. Highly recommended!","746":"Acquired by the very friendly and helpful new owner Tamie in May 2014, Med-Physique at 3 Graces now offers several new spa services, including Exlis, Botox, Juvederm, specialized peels, laser hair removal...as well as a variety of message styles to choose from and organic airbrush spray tanning...all in the newly remodeled spa facility. \n\nAlthough I loved my services provided at 3 Graces before, the space was indeed in need of a bit of a \"makeover\" itself. Great new facility and treatment options; however, I only visit for message or spray tans so I can't speak to quality of other services.","747":"Went in for lunch, we are vegetarian & British. We were limited to chips & we were fine with that. \n\nI ordered 4 portions of chips & got very delicious crisps. (Potato chips) we explained to the girl at the counter that we expected chips that come with fish, not fries. I guess we should have clarified but being in a fish n chip shop in a concentrated Brit tourist area I didn't think I needed to lol\n\nAnyways we paid for an additional 2 portions on \"fries\" & waited again. 2 more boxes came out with battered fries. Wasn't expecting that & although we just wanted plain old chip shop chips we did still enjoy. \n\nSo I suggest trying the garlic & Parmesan POTATO CHIPS & hopefully the staff can learn to double check what people mean lol","748":"My first Yelp experience was choosing movers and Precision Moving seemed like a great option.  From the Yelp review, to the website to the actual move, Precision Moving provided the BEST moving experience my wife and I have ever had (at least 6-8 moves between us).  Rudy, Gil and Jeff were professional, careful and efficient.  Although I haven't used all the Boston companies, I would say Precision Moving strikes the balance between cost and quality.  Easy 5-star recommendation.","749":"I'll start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I haven't tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome.","750":"This was a pretty big disappointment. We paid extra to essentially stay in the park (what would be normal hours any other month) but with Halloween decorations. All the attractions had hour and a half waits. \"But you can purchase an express pass to bypass the lines!\" Sorry, I don't like the idea of paying the theme park to get to the front of the line. Universal has good attractions, but it's like playing a freemium game once inside. They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions.\n\nThe scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though. It seemed most of the crowd was younger, too. We (30 year olds) felt a little too old for the event.\n\nThe best part of this was that Diagon Alley was EMPTY. We rode Escape from Gringott's twice in a row with no wait. All the shops which are normally shoulder-to-shoulder during the day had plenty of space to enjoy. We were able to ride almost every ride in the park twice with no wait before the crowds swarmed back in.\n\nIn short, worth it for the lack of crowds after 5 and before about 9, but lame Halloween gags targeted to teens and presented by teens.","751":"This place is a gem. The donuts are the best EVER. The girls that work here are super friendly and the deli is delicious. I don't live anywhere near this shop but I make special trips to get donuts, coffee, and scratch tickets nearly every Sunday. \n\nOh and they are open 24\/7.","752":"Jesse and Ashley do an awesome job w gels and give the best pedicures. The place is just a little expensive but totally worth it.  Getting a pedicure as we speak....\nIt's so relaxing .... zzzzzzzz :)","753":"I stopped at black seed cafe on my way to the hotel room after a tiring 6 hour tour of the entire city and when i entered there was nothing on my mind but to get something to eat. There a lot of options you can choose from when ordering specially for the wraps. I ordered the Bahamas chicken hot wrap to try something out of the ordinary and it was delicious. Beside from having a lot of tomatoes in it, the zucchini and eggplant were well done and enhanced the flavor. If you ever go there let them know what to hold in your wrap so you don't end up with a lot of tomatoes on you plate in the end.","754":"Ok, lets get through this. The pizza is on point. Its not the best in the world, maybe not the best in town even, but you cant go wrong with any pie on their list. \n\nGood service, good food, lots of parking, cant go wrong.","755":"Good food, fast service and friendly staff!! Pancakes fluffy and patty melt very tasty!!! Wendy is fabulous!!!","756":"The pie is awesome! However, the staff is kinda rude. My party of 4, one of which was from out of town, showed up at 9:30 pm. We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out. The neighborhood was a buzz with people walking around. Other bars and restaurants were open and packed. I won't bother going back. I will take my business to Pix Patisserie.","757":"Place seemed dingy and the food was meh at best.  The staff seemed friendly enough and the food came out in a decent amount if time.  I just couldn't shake an uneasy feeling like I was going to wind up with food poisoning (I did not get food poisoning) it just doesn't feel clean in there. I would not go again.","758":"About Skyview (from their website):\n\"Towering nearly 20 stories above Centennial Park, the SkyView Ferris wheel features 42 climate-controlled gondolas providing guest with breathtaking panoramic views of downtown Atlanta and the surrounding metropolitan area. Those looking for an even more enhanced experience will enjoy our VIP gondola boasting Ferrari leather seats, glass floor and a longer flight time. And, with its convenient location just steps from many of Atlanta's most popular attractions, SkyView Atlanta is the perfect compliment to your downtown adventure.\"\n \nTook my ex on a date night of things that he loves. Skyview was something he had wanted to try out so I planned a visit during our night out. Adult tickets are $13.50 but they have military discount. And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets. Cool. There was a line, but we got on the ride quickly. I was afraid that the ride was gonna be really quick since it was near closing, but it actually seemed like we were on there for a good amount of time. It was beautiful seeing Atlanta all lit up from the sky, but I wish I could have seen it during daytime. Guess i will have to go back.","759":"Friends and I usually go here almost out of necessity - it's nearby and we are often given coupons. There are plenty of TVs, but it can still be a headache to catch a game here when the place gets so busy. Recently, we (a couple of 20 somethings) informed the hostess that we wanted to watch the Falcons game - she then sat us in a room only showing the Steelers game, right next to a table with two small children. I don't mind kids - but during football Sunday, I don't want to have to watch my language either. We moved outside in the heat and had to take a seat in front of a TV that's had a shady, black spot in the middle of the screen for months. Get that fixed, man.\n\nThe parking is particularly AWFUL. It can take 20 minutes to find a spot, and I've known many people who have had to park across the street at Marta and walk over. The food is just okay, the beer selection is good, and the service is iffy - it really depends on who you get.","760":"Was curious about this place since before it opened when I noticed the large \"DINER\" lettering atop the building. \nAnd finally after more than a few weeks I had the opportunity to walk over and have breakfast. And it was a great time. Friendly staff, Jenn was a sweetheart. Concise and modern \"diner\" menu, and the food was delicious!!!","761":"Nice brunch spot.  The berries and cream crepes was so good.  I also tried the summer in italy which is french toast with fruits which was also pretty good.  Ordered takeout this time but would definitely come back to dine in.","762":"Went to the Reggae Brunch with a large group. We called ahead 3 days before to get a reservation but were told that if our party showed up promptly at 11 we would be seated without a reservation. We were assured that we did not have a reservation and everything would be all set. \n\nWe waited around as the hostess figured out what to do with us and said that no one would've told us this over the phone. Meanwhile, there were many empty tables and people waiting to be seated. Finally after 40 minutes and a mixture of possible seating combinations, we were seated together in the back of the restaurant. During our entire meal the restaurant had many empty tables, yet did not sit everyone that came in.\n\nThe waitress came right over and took drink orders. Beyond this though the service was awful. I did not get my meal until all the other 12 people in the party were almost done eating. The check was wrong and the promise of removing drinks\/my meal from the bill was not done. At this point we were ready to just get out of the restaurant and it took another 30 minutes to get the bill situated as it had been miscalculated between cash and cards. \n\nThe band was the best part! They were great but the food was mediocre and service was awful. Most likely won't go back.","763":"Dinky place, big taste!  If you want some traditional and great Chinese food you can find it here (note the roasted ducks with the heads still attached and you know you're in the right place).\n\nTry their BBQ pork, Chaxaw pork, BBQ cuttlefish, crispy skin pork, and the dishes they have written on the menu on the wall.  The flavor is great, just like Chen's down the street.  Place is small so I usually just do take out and eat at home but the flavor is not the same as if you dine in since they do something to the dish in the back (adding different type of sauces) which make the food taste batter (plus they heat it up).  Try the noodles and wontons also, it's pretty good, but I rather have other type of noodles instead of yellow egg noodles).  \n\nIf you like Chinese food and want something different than typical take out places then this is the one you have to try!","764":"The food is pretty OK there, but the service was good. One thing I really felt cheated is the ordering of the table side guacamole. We have 5 people in our party, when we placed the order for the guacamole, the server asked us since we have 5 people, do we want to have one more avocado for the guacamole. We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.","765":"I went here for a birthday, had one of my worst experiences at a restaurant, and joined Yelp just to write this review.\nI went with my girlfriend for dinner during mid-week and found the place doing decent, though not busy, so we were at least seated promptly. Everything went downhill from there.\nWe started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. \nDo not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location).","766":"We came here for Dine out Vancouver. Awesome service, they were very accomodating and we had a  great dinning experience here.  Will come back again to try out their regular menu","767":"Its no 99 cents only store, but its a decent dollar store... \n \nDon't park in the lot where the Starbucks\/FedEx is (which is the SAME building)-- I was the dollar tree for 10 minutes and I got a 34$  ticket...  made my dollar store experience pretty pricey. They apparently validate for the underground garage around the block.","768":"Went there for my little sisters 21st birthday and we loved it. Cocktails lived up to the hype, food was fantastic and our waitress, Julia was an absolute doll. Atmosphere was great for an intiment occasion. Definitely be coming back!","769":"First, I would like to shout out Tavrious! Their system assures amazing customer service, but Tavarious knew we were from out of town and worked with us!!! Tavarious is amazing. I came from DC and I'm a stickler for costumer service! All of the drinks were hand crafted and strong! The manager explained the entire system and business bc I was honestly confused why there is NOT one in DC, I even offered to invest in one... Yes, it was that amazing!!!! I recommend the duck taco or bowl & the pork belly!!! Again, amazing spot and my new ATL favorite!!","770":"I just loving going to TT's to see my buddy  Kevin playing for the Raging Teens.  Can't be the cheap PBR's, great music and diverse crowd.  \n\nAlways a great time and loads of good bands...","771":"I am not a customer here, but as a healthcare worker I come here frequently as part of my job.\n\nI can say that this is one of the worst medical centers in the city. Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients. \n\nThe staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people. \n\nThis place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County. Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients. \n\nDo yourself and the staff at DMC a favor. Go somewhere else.","772":"I was really disappointed to say the least. I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\n\nOur waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \n\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\n\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. \n\nThis place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things.","773":"Tried this place for lunch today.  It's not bad but nothing to get excited about.  Interesting mix of choices, mostly Mediterranean themed.  They have a nice display of their fresh salads and other choices. \n\nI had the Tabbouleh with gyro meat which was actually pretty good.  The sauce needs more flavor.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the location is convenient.  Just a head's up, a lot of day laborers hang out in the parking area because of the Home Depot nearby.","774":"So, line up outside the door, but plenty of clean and empty tables inside. Waltz up to the hostess to be ignored... Charming. Told 15 minute wait, sure thing, we'll head to a store nearby for a look and come back shortly. Again, empty tables everywhere, but still a line up out the front. Ordered food, said food was delivered to the table. Wait staff only barely able to muster up enough 'customer service' to scrape by...\n\nI made the mistake of ordering the shrimp... Spent the rest of my Saturday in the bathroom throwing my insides up. Pleasant. Needless to say I will never be back, as I've since heard other horror stories from other patrons at various other Max & Erma's.\n\nLift your game. I don't like having a New Years long weekend destroyed by a third rate meal and then the after effects of what can only come down to poor kitchen practices. I should probably report this establishment to the appropriate authorities.","775":"I purchased my tank from The Wet Spot about 10 years ago. This tank was very successful - most of the fish living for a very long time. We decided to add live plants and a couple new fish about 3 years ago. That was the last time I was there. Customer service at that time was severely lacking and almost all employees seemed rude\/agitated. Maybe you could blame that one on the severe humidity in the place - it's almost unbearable.\nWe wandered in there yesterday, the whole time my bf muttering under his breath about how he didn't want to be there, didn't want to deal with anyone's shitty attitude, and thought the place was overpriced.....\nI just wanted to test the water in our tank, add some new fish, maybe a frog and some cool plants. Enter Colby...... the MOST helpful, patient fish person EVER!! He tested the water, gave us suggestions to up the pH level and spent the next hour with us. He helped us pick out fish, lights, plants..... He was Awesome.\nI'm so glad we decided to give them another shot. As long as Colby is there, we will continue to go back.","776":"Have been here twice, and I live 300 miles away.\nStopped in the first time a week ago and I had the Guru Rice while my wife had Noble Broccoli...they were both awesome and we left totally full. Power combo of flavor and portion size with these dishes.\n\nThen today we were swept back to Portland on the trade winds and decided to stop in with our friends. everyone enjoyed their food. we even shared around. even our non-vegan friend loved his food...so this place is a win.","777":"This place is truly exceptional! \n\nMy big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \n\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.","778":"This place has so much potential for a family adventure.  Monster Trucks, Orange slushies, cheesy decorations galore.  But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide.  \nPart one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. \nCritique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. \nCritique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \nPart two in the store:\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\n\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.","779":"I have had dinner from El Potro 3 times since they have opened.  One time we did take out and I have sat in there twice.  Every time that we've gone there, we have had great service.  The food is delicious too.  I have not had their margarita, but I have heard good things.  The decor is bright and appropriate for a mexican restaurant.  I am excited to try their breakfast!","780":"I don't know what we would have done if we didn't find Kim to purchase our 1st home. We relocated from So. Cal, and she was with us through some tough situations and made it a cake walk throughout the entire process. She and Julie Davis are amazing. They are extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. We had tons of questions and concerns and they addressed everything in a timely manner. Thanks so much Kim & Julie for helping us find our beautiful home! - R & B","781":"Popped in one night about an hour before Closing. Found out ,with a stamped ticket, Parking is free for 2 hours. A, plus. Stood in line for about 15 minutes, then the door matron let me in, to stand in another line(very long). Was chatting with a couple in line and, one of them said you can sit at the bar and get quicker service. So I sauntered over to the one remaining seat. The bartender was friendly, took my order. Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked. Got out for around $16.","782":"We ordered the Miso soup and for entree, the U.N. and Chanel rolls.  All of the items were excellent.  Our drinks were also very good: The Mule, Apple Old Fashioned.","783":"We came here immediately after getting off the plane from Los Angeles, and it was an ideal choice made by our friends.\n\nIt was very un-LA and I loved it. The prices were so reasonable, we came during happy hour though, so that helped. I had the Mac n cheese of the day and a quesadilla (all off the happy hour menu, but you'd never guess flavor wise). The beer only cost 3 dollars! And it was a local microbrew that made me happy. Beer always makes me happy though. I've been told this place is best for breakfast, but I guess I'll have to wait till next time!","784":"Not a fan. My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.","785":"This is fantastic! We had cold lobster rolls and shrimp burgers at our server Amy's advice. She was spot on! The grilled octopus and fish dip as appetizers were worth the fuller belly than we planned!  Again, Amy came through when we asked what to dip the homemade chips in. My hubby and her discussed what he liked and she actually went back and mixed her own dip of horseradish, Old Bay and mayo, and we basically dipped EVERYTHING in it! We could not be happier with Amy or our stop here!","786":"Very Bad Service......\ni have been using this car wash for couple years, only doing exterior and driving it my self, through out last year i have been noticing how rude people are there, but i never interacted with them, until recently when i decided it to use full service, so i gave them my car then i went to the other end waiting for, once it came out i notice it the person who is driving it can not open the door from inside, so i opened it from outside then i realized that they  broke then handler from inside, so i asked for a manager, and when he came i was trying to explain to him the situation but what shocked me is that from the beginning he was to aggressive with and he does not even want to listen to me, so i realized that this guy is no gooooood, by the way i am a regular customer so when i told him that, his answer was take your business, his argument was that things broke, and we are not responsible for them.\n\nthe sad thing i called there office which is located in Malden, guess what the woman who is responsible for taking complaints is never available. \n\ni used to spent at least $200 every month there. Not Any More.\n\nif i could i would rate it zero star.","787":"Service,  Sat with 2 friends at the bar. Craig was great.  Knowledgeable,  friendly and funny.\nFood,  Calamari and Brescetta to start....both great.  Entrees; Veal Marsala, Salmon,  Veal spinach ALL GREAT. Can't say enough.","788":"I was lucky enough to visit Pabu twice last week - first before a show then again to celebrate a birthday dinner. \n\nEach visit the staff was attentive and cared about our experience. On my second visit they remembered me by name! \n\nWe did the omakase at the sushi bar (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and our personal sushi Chef Ray along with Chef Brian gave us an amazing tasting of nigiri while showing us and explaining each special treatment of the fish. All of the staff, including the management, stopped by to say happy birthday and check if we needed anything. \n\nthis is my favorite place for Japanese cocktails. Each time I went back to the Classic Lolita (Japanese Old Fashion) and Porco Rosso (named after my favorite cartoon character!).\n\nWhether or not you're looking for an authentic Japanese tasting or picking plates from the never disappointing a la carte menu Pabu is the spot to dine.","789":"Wow seriously Starbucks! Get with it!! Not only was the drive thru lady extremely rude on April 1st at 12:00pm but my coffee was not even full! If I wanted a half a cup of coffee do you think I would come to Starbucks!? I will NOT be coming back to this location. If this was an April Fools joke some future advice... don't mess with someone's coffee! :\/","790":"I cant tell you how much I love Hertz and its #1 Gold Priority Service.  Hertz makes it so easy to get to your car, and leave!  I never have to wait in line filling out paperwork I have already done online.  Get off the plane, find my number, go to the exit and already on my way.  Pricing is never much more and most the time cheaper than what the other places will nickel and dime you.  The time you get back not waiting in line for them to assign you a car is worth so much more.  The kids are already antsy from the flight, throw them in the car and get on the road to a happy vacation!","791":"This was one of the few physical therapy places in the Boston area recommended to me by Massachusetts General Hospital for help with a broken wrist.  It was great in all aspects, and I would also highly recommend.","792":"Not as expected  Room cleaning service not so good lots of dust.  children diving & swimming in hot tub.  Floats of all sizes allowed in pool, lots of kids splashing.  No TV when it rains.  Looked like free summer camp. Saw 2 women with 15 kids.  I counted them twice.  Loud disrespectful kids all over the place. Not a place to relax. The beds have the worst mattresses.  5 nights, room cleaned one time.  Maid service comes late while we were back in room.  Shuttle bus to Universal.  We had to take a cab.","793":"I met up with a friend here the other day on a sunny afternoon. First of all, I love the name of this place. I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!","794":"Got gel mani and opi pedi. The pedi was great! Loved it. \nHowever, the gel mani wasn't very pleasant -- the surfaces are uneven; got gel on my fingertips; top coat got on my index finger and a small part of my skin was burnt under the nail lamp... Hurt a lot \n(well, maybe it was because they were doing my mani and pedi at the same time, and the leg massage made my hands moved? )","795":"I went here a few weeks ago and had the best experience. The food was amazing and fresh, the service was excellent. The two people serving us which we think might have been the owners were so friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!!","796":"I come here for dinner with a bunch of friends every now and again. Beer list is good, fried pickles are tasty, and the staff is generally stellar. I've been happy with the grilled cheese and club sandwiches I've ordered. Once we came here and there was an embarrassing bro cover band, but I don't think that is a regular occcurance. \n\nPrices are good and this place adds a much needed casual but nice dining option to Malden.","797":"Small food court, but you come here for the beignets.  Its not the best, and by far not NOLA, but its still a treat.  I wish they had better coffee to go with the beignets.\n\nFood wise, its ok.  Service could be better.  Many of the workers have an attitude. Not sure if they really don't want to be working there, or, if that's the attitude of the \"south\" or New Awlins types.  Whatever.  Don't need to give me attitude when I'm confuseed what's considered a snack point or an entree! I'm a tourist with a food plan, not a local regular.\n\n3 stars for the service, and perpahs the lack of selection for a food court.  Riverside, just down the walkway, has more variety, but no beignets.","798":"Came with the family on a saturday nite. Service and food was great. It was a little pricey for what it was but the live music made up for it. im not usually a fan of live music at resarsunts but this was great! Cant go wrong with johnny cash and Willie.","799":"This is my favorite bar in Austin, and I frequently use it to give people a sense of what Austin is all about. It's like the hippest backyard you've ever been to. It's very laid back, and a little bit out of the way. They have an Italian food truck in the back called Patrizi's that is developing a really good, and really well-deserved reputation.\n\nNow that they have a full bar, I can't imagine a better place to hang out and relax.","800":"Hate to say this but they leave the food on the warmer over heated and soggy. It's not like there's a lot of people by 1:45pm but Christ people will be eating what they paid for! Yup that's what I had, a soggy string beans and broccoli. Yuck! Do a better job please!!!","801":"I've had ramen from Japan to New York and places in between. The ramen was way too oily. Pretty gross, actually.","802":"It's close, it's not quick, but it's easy to get to and have lots of lunch and dinner options.  Breakfast on the other hand had pretty limited options. It's a quick service food court. You really can't expect much.","803":"Surprisingly good for Italian in Vancouver. My only criticism was that there needed to be a few more pasta choices.  I also thought that I prefer my meatballs mildly herbed and they were a bit too spicy for my linking. In spite of the few shortcomings it was a nice find and I'm amazed I hadn't eaten here before tonight. Definitely going back.","804":"Passport services are on the 2nd floor. You can take the stairs just to the right of the main entrance to the International Office or take the elevator from inside. I arrived at 8:10am to have passport photos taken. I was out of there within 10 minutes with photos in hand. There were two families queued up for actual passport services. Since I just needed passport photos, the receptionist took the photo and processed my payment. There is a separate counter for processing passports and ESL services. Great experience!!","805":"Ciao!\n\nHere on. Tuesday at 6pm.  The staff, cuisine and ambience was wowza wowza!\n\nGreeted and seated immediately and couldn't have been more friendly.\n\nWe ordered soups, dinners off the daily menus.  I had the mushroom penne, side of meatballs.  Hubby had the chicken cacittoria.  All excellent.\n\nBiscotti' for dessert.  $52\n\nWe will be back.","806":"Wanted to like it, just couldn't. \nSeafood tasted frozen and freezer burnt - nothing was even edible. \nWe left hungry and ate elsewhere.","807":"Service wasn't great. Very slow prepping, and the food tasted very bland. Overall pretty disappointing experience. I wish they would have the regular menu at lunch. Maybe their regular pasta would taste better but I won't be back to wait another an hour to try","808":"Great place to eat German food and drink German beer, and it won't make a hole in your wallet.  The only thing negative is the neighborhood.  If your dinning here at night, please be aware of your surroundings.","809":"Came to Wonder Spice with a friend who grew up going there. The two servers we had were very friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! They heard me talking about how I'd had a certain dish spicy somewhere else and offered to make my meal spicy. Big portions and a comfy atmosphere-great for lunch or dinner--reasonably priced as well.","810":"Wonderful Vietnamese food. Have gone here 3 times already since they opened barely 2 weeks ago. They're so nice and friendly, and the food is amazing. My partner is strict vegan as well and there were plenty of options.","811":"Gave it a try... twice. Shame on me. Not very good BBQ. Unfortunate as I live across the street.  Will not be back.","812":"Le's is always a win. I've been gong here with my family for many years now and have never had a negative experience. My favorite dishes are lemongrass chicken and any of the wide-rice noodle dishes. What makes both of these dishes great is the flavoring. It's hard to describe precisely, the best way to explain is just that  they get the flavor right here.","813":"My house is two blocks from here, and it's taken me this long to try Sauced due to the mediocre reviews found here, as well as word of mouth. Based on my experience last night, my concerns were unwarranted. \n\nDined with a friend, and we shared; \npork cracklins - delicious, perfectly fried, seasoned well, and way bigger serving than I expected, \nblack-eyed pea fritters - delicious, perfectly fried, larger than I expected (Asian chili dipping sauce good, but the others were meh), white bratwurst - not my cup of tea, so I shouldn't speak to this one,\ncaesar salad - very enjoyable, grilled effect was quite nice,\nskewer trio (selected brisket, chicken, & shrimp) - this was quite a mediocre dish, came with weird uncomplimentary sauces, only thing I had that I wouldn't recommend.\n\nPS This was way too much food, we totally rolled out of there. My plan is to return with my man, have a couple drinks, some pork cracklins and black-eyed pea fritters, and call it a night.\n\nOn the drink side, the menu was nice. Turn the page to get past the $10 house cocktails, as the second page has the $6 ones. I had a Harvey Wallbanger, quite nice. My friend had a sazerac which he enjoyed.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience. Total tab was $55. The decor was comfortable, not at all as overwrought or kitschy as I was expecting. We sat in the back on the rounded booth which was quite comfortable. The noise level was very acceptable until just before we left when the place was packed, about 8:30pm on a Thu. And Ria was playing hostess. She was extremely welcoming, and gave us our pick of table.  \n\nI consider this a great addition to the hood. And I'm looking forward to coming back, sitting on the front deck, having a cocktail, and enjoying the street scene.","814":"This is a great place to go, kick back with friends, and eat some good food. No - it's not 5-star high end cuisine. No - it's not an up-scale trendy pick-up bar. But it's also not TRYING to be any of those things. \n\nIt HAS a bar, but it's for local friends to chill, catch the evening news, and have a drink. It's not the spot you are going to find your new European Super Model Wife. But they don't claim that you will. The bar is not the main part of this restaurant. The bar is just there so that they have one. The reason to visit is for some good food and to be in a relaxing environment with friends. \n\nBetween my husband and I - we've tried almost everything on the menu, and so far, we can't complain. The French Onion soup is a good, solid standard. I'm told to try the meatloaf (but my husband is a poopie-head, because he knows I don't eat beef). My personal favs are the club sandwich (minus the pork products) and their crab cakes. They also have really good onion rings. \n\nAll in all -- thumbs up. Stop on by.","815":"There was only one flavor of bubble tea at that time so I guess I would get it sooner than I thought. The truth is the people who ordered after me got their drinks first, and one of them ordered the same drink. The cashier, who was in charge, I assumed, didn't feel sorry when I complained, and joked with the staffs who were making the tea in Mandarin. So I talked to her again in Mandarin, repeating what I said earlier in English, and she provoked me by telling her colleagues to ease and take their time to make my bubble tea. \nThe drink is ok. I could taste some taro in the milk tea so I could tell it wasn't just some flavored powder in it. But the service is the WORST.","816":"First of all, to be frank, my friend's Power Pizza was served uncut. We were all very disappointed and astonished. Additionally, my other friend's Shrimp Fettuccine only had approximately five pieces of shrimp. Also, there was a paper table cover on the table but we were not supplied crayons for our pre-dinner rituals. Furthermore, my friend who is lactose intolerant received cheese on her Shrimp Fettucine. Finally, we asked for the check and received it about 6.9 minutes later. Overall, the experience was unforgettable and we made mems nonetheless. 10\/10, would recommend. \n\nP.S. Beautiful toilets!","817":"College Optical is wonderful!  They are always attentive and ensure that my prescription is up to date and correct.  Their selection of glasses is incredible.  At each of my visits, they spent time with me to pick out glasses, fit me for contacts and discuss my insurance benefits.  Not once did I feel rushed or unheard.  Most importantly Dr. Holland and the rest of the staff are always friendly, helpful and honest.  100% would recommend this business.","818":"I ate here 4 times in my week in Portland. Partly because it was across the street from my friend's house but mostly because it was really good. \n\nThe oatmeal pancakes were really really good. And the short stack is still huge. Their organic syrups are super amazing.","819":"I always avoided getting our carpets cleaned at our old house because it seemed like such a hassle, but I made a vow to do better in the new place. Several people on our neighborhood FB page recommended Peacefrog so I decided to give them a try. Called on NYE day and got a friendly scheduler who explained everything. The technician, Mike, arrived on time and worked quickly. He was aware of our cat and gave him a chance to hide before getting started. We had a pet stain that wouldn't come up and we weren't charged for the extra cleaning attempt. Carpet looks great and the whole thing (upstairs and stairs only) took about two hours, plus drying time. Good job! Definitely would use again.","820":"Since this place is located near some decent hotels and in an okay looking strip mall, I thought I'd give it a chance despite other reviews.  I wouldn't expect the people I saw in here to stay in any motel other than one that rents by the hour.  The food was actually pretty good.  Hot and a decent selection despite the size.  Number one problem is the inside.  Run down, dirty carpets, a young girl sweeping right next to me as I ate.  Number two, and probably the biggest reason to avoid is the clientele.  The absolute dregs of humanity.  If the guy talking very loudly in his phone didn't bother you, you could have picked from the idiot playing Pok\u0413\u00a9mon as he went around the buffet.  Oh wait, when he wasn't playing, he was definitely not disciplining his child.  The little boy was screaming and yelling and he nor his wife did a thing.  If you need a boost to your self esteem, come here and discover there are much more people not deserving to live on this planet.  Feel good about yourself and thank the stars you aren't in this classless class of morons.","821":"Car tint was installed by Sunbusters.  Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.\n\nI'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.\n\nIf you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place.","822":"Great place.. good burgers.. surely like this one!","823":"Damn, I am so glad Henry's partner at Otto's told me to get the F- out when I asked why did my 10 dollar lunch turned into  a 22 dollar lunch?  So anyway I am still wanting some pizza, so I get on line and this place seems to fit the bill.  So I order a small pizza and salad.. costs less than what I would have paid at Otto's..  HELLO..  and they brought it to my front door with a smile.. so good, I just wish that I had someone to share it with..  way too much for one...","824":"Went here because of the positive reviews - I hope my experience was an anomaly, but I won't be coming back. \n\nDelightful waitress; rest of staff seemed like new hires that didn't quite understand customer service.\n\nOmelette and hash browns were uninspired, flavorless, and burnt. Ordered iced coffee, black, which also tasted quite burnt (I drink black iced coffee all the time - it's supposed to taste bitter, but this was definitely burnt). \n\nMy candid opinion- I really do hope other people have a better experience here.","825":"The service is terrible, overpriced hookah that wasn't worth it. The owner was very unprofessional. Never would go there again. Actually looking forward to see this place shut down.","826":"This place got lots special flavor bbt~ \nLove the Oreo green tea cheesecake and they have a few selection of savoury dishes too (curry fish balls, teriyaki rice bowl etc... Also hot or cold tofu flower dessert :D \nNice place for grab and go :) only thing is the wait is a bit long~ ordered 2 drinks on a Tuesday night at 10pm, waited 15 minutes and it's not packed busy tonight. Prepare yourself with a patient while waiting for your yummy sweets.","827":"Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years.   The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.","828":"BEST BRUNCH EVER. we waited about an hour to be seated, it was super busy. And definitely worth the wait  the restaurant is very compact with close tables, you get to know your neighbors very quickly. They have a coffee and waffle bar right in the front with unusual dipping sauces for the famous waffles. I had the milk chocolate lavender with a waffle  a nice treat before brunch! My hubby and I ordered the salmon fume and paella. Both were delicious! The flavors dance on your tongue this place is at the top of our list EVERYTIME were in BC! \nSalmon fume: 5\nPaella: 5\nWaffle + milk choc lavender: 4","829":"Me and The Piegon went this past Saturday around 4 in the afternoon. It was a good thing we got there when we did, because around 20 minutes after we were seated the rather small wait turned into a real Charlie-Foxtrot. \n\nThere were 40 people lined up along the small front waiting area of the joint shooting daggers at those that were already sitting and enjoying their food. The looks were those of desperation and hunger, coupled with a few who looked like they were dragged there by their wives and girlfriends because it's new and cool and would rather have said screw it and headed to Neuvo Laredo just around the corner.\n\nThe Piegon got the Butcher's Cut and I got the Flip Burger; we split the Onion rings. The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. \n\nWe actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange. \n\nWe split the Nutella and burnt marshmellow shake, it was O.K, nothing to slap family members about.\n\nOverall the experience and burgers were good and we will certainly head back over to Howell Mill Rd to eat there again.","830":"Have walked past this place for months meaning to try it.  And, have absolutely no regrets about finally doing so today.  On previous occasions it looked like it had just a few customers in there but today it was half full when I got in.  My timing was perfect as within 5 mins of my arrival, the rest of the place filled up with a wide assortment of folk\n\nI ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious. Extremely flavourful and raise the roof off the top of your mouth, not blow it off, spicy. !  In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.\n\nI was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. \n\nI am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample.  I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful in an understated way.  Could not stop myself rubber necking to get a good look at how the casual yet classy ambiance  had been accomplished with a subtle colour scheme and textures. \n\nWill definitely go back and was suitably impressed to take others with me","831":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Been coming here for years.  The moment you walk in and sit down you immediately feel like you're in someone's persian family home and ready to eat a home cooked persian meal.  If you're more into the \"experience\" of dining out, you may be critical of this place, because they're not about glitz and glamour, they are about DAMN GOOD FOOD!\n\nThe beef kebabs always come out scrumptious, the flat bread, the persian style lentils and rice, I'm not even kidding my mouth is watering just typing this out.\n\nIt's also a very culturally interesting place to eat, because it's the only place where during any given lunch time, you can see Israelis, Arabs and Persians all eating in the same room feasting on the same delicious eatery.  Now if only we could get the entire middle east to run like this resteraunt things will be great :)\n\nBeen coming here for at least 7 years and won't stop for another 7+.","832":"Best fat burger in town ( there are many types fat\/skinny\/greasy\/etc Hoppdoddy has the best Fat burger) cool ambiance, great idea ( sustainable eating) its not a new idea, but i like the way they make it easy to understand for those of us that don't usually partake. My personal favorite is the Greek burger, and the Hard Cherry Lime-aid with Gin or vodka... for dessert try the Salted Caramel shake... they also have the real sugar sodas... DEFINITELY GO THERE  :)","833":"First of all- the Staff is amazing.  Everyone is super nice and always cheery.  I usually opt for the drive thu because in the morning I'm lazy and don't want to get out of my car.  On the off chance I do go inside I feel like I'm waiting FOREVER for my order.  I almost feel like the drive thru is faster.  My advice is wait in the drive thru line- you'll get your drink faster.","834":"Wish I could give zero stars, this review is for the food not the service. Over priced NOT authentic vietnamese food. $6.5 for a banh mi (vietnamese sandwich), seriously?? hoagie bread not the usual banh mi bread and they skimp on the meat and veggie toppings. The dipping fish sauce that came with the spring rolls were salty and lack sweetness. So disappointed...The Pho (beef noodle soup) was overly spiced, my parents couldn't even finished their meals. Will not be returning and would not recommend.","835":"I recently took two of my D.C. buddies here to \"experience\" Austin. Why did I do this? Because up until my last visit there, which happened to be on a Friday morning, I have always enjoyed this restaurant. Their food is very good, and that is the only reason I have left them 2 stars. However, their hostess actually ignored me for a good 30 seconds when I walked in because she was playing 'read my lips' with someone across the room. As a customer, I found this to be disrespectful. Then she tried to seat us next to the kitchen- when I pointed to an available table on the other side of the room, she got pissy. At this point I was just embarrassed that this restaurant was going to be my guest's first impression of Austin. The drinks are overpriced and plain. I won't be going back, South Congress Cafe has become absurdly busy and pretentious...maybe South Congress in general has just lost its charm.","836":"Great food, great service, Great location! We tried their veggie momos last Friday. Never had such a tasty momos. When we went there owner was actively working in the kitchen. Staff are very pleasing and friendly. Service was very quick as well. Will definitely be one of their frequent customers!","837":"Richard was great. \n*  Showed up on time\n*  Focused on the areas I requested\n*  Went the extra mile by organizing things! \n\nI really appreciated his eye for detail. I am going to request him again soon :)","838":"Stopped here for lunch before a road trip. I had the grilled cheese and fruit bowl.  It was ok.  Nothing exciting but not horrible.\nMom got the short stack of banana nut pancakes.  She said they were good but not awesome.  Very generous portion as she couldn't finish them.\nI'll go back to try it again.","839":"Yup, 5 flippin' stars. I'm just going to delve into the facts, the Szechaun beef noodle is literally THE best I've had. There was so much that I had to take the rest to go and the leftovers even sufficed as a whole meal of their own. The noodles were soft yet not soggy, the broth was...oh gosh, so good. So flavorful and comforting. It's like if your mom made you a nice heaping bowl full of love. The beef chunks were plentiful and not full of tendons like most places. It just falls apart when you eat it. Price wise, the noodles costed about 9 dollars, pretty dang good for what you get. \n\nWe also ordered the beef rolls, basically the green onion pancake wrapped around some beef and hoisin sauce. Four in an order, and trust me, you will get full off of two. The green onion pancake was nice and flaky like green onion pancakes should be, so thumbs up to RiceBowl for nailing that. \n\nI'll be back, RiceBowl. Just have a bowl of beef noodle waiting for me!","840":"I don't know but the pizza has gone down hill the last 2 times I ordered.\n\nIt was so remarkably bad that I had to order chicken fingers as a back up just in case... Glad I did!\n\nThe crust is longer fluffy and buttery deliciousness with the perfect fluffy chewy\/crispy texture.\n\nFeels like chewing cardboard... Kind of tastes like it too.... What happened?  Is it frozen now?\n\nI don't know... \n\nBut the plain chicken fingers with sauces on the side were good enough to mention... Pretty big, tender pieces of white meat, with crispy, flavorful batter.\n\nSo... If you want chicken fingers you have my permission to order them... \n\nHopefully by the time you go, they will not have changed that recipe.\n\nIf you want great, gourmet-like style pizza go around the corner to All Star Pizza Bar!  \n\nThey have huge slices, and many different varieties and fantastic flavor combos!\n\nMy friend love the Redhead, I usually just try any slice that speaks to me that day whether it's cheese, a meat option or something funky... Yes... Funky is an option and it varies daily... Way to keep us on our pizza toes!\n\nWant pizza?  Go to All Star now!!! Run, don't walk far away from here! Lol","841":"I first time here, but I like this place!) See u soon again , thank you so much for amazing coffee ) and sandwich))) mmmm yammy yammy))        .","842":"This hotel never disappoints me!! Stayed here with my wife for our 1 Year Anniversary and the package we paid for was above and beyond what we were expecting. Mira called us the morning of checkin and went over all the details in regards to our stay. Jason our driver dropped us off to dinner and was there in no time to pick us up. Jason gave us 5 Star service! My wife told me that she felt like we were out of town so that tells you how great of a stay we had. Only down side of the stay was trying to hangout at the pool. Recommend you get to the pool early if you want to have somewhere to sit and hangout. Other than that we had a true 5 Star stay!! We will be back!!","843":"I like it. I work very close to this place and I've only gotten their food delivered. That being said I've never dined in the actual establishment. \n\nSo far I've tried: \n\nsalad rolls: fresh and delicious with their perfectly spicy peanut sauce. \n\nTomyum: it's ok. It's a little too sweet for my taste but some people like it that way. \n\nPineapple fried rice: mmmmmmmmm, that is all.\n\nTropical cashew crispy chicken: very delicious. My second favorite. \n\nThai Smile chicken wing: OMG. The best on the menu. My favorite item here. \n\nThere's a lot of good Thai in Portland and this is pretty legit. If you go I would recommend something off of he signature house special portion of the menu rather than the usual pad Thai or curry from this restaurant because I'm sure you've found your favorites of those elsewhere and it would be unfair to judge them that way.","844":"This is a good default breakfast place. There service is always very good. They have a large menu. Nothing is truly amazing here, but everything I've had is good. There is something on the menu for most people here.","845":"This is a cute little gem of a cafe. For the vegan in our party they had vegan French toast, tofu scramble, and vegan sausage, while I had a ham and caramelized onion omelet. Both were phenomenal leaving us both happy. The one downside was the smash browns, but everything else was so good we overlooked that...","846":"I miss Boston Tea Stop!  My favorite stop for boba in Boston.  A cute little place just off of Harvard Square.  It's pretty small, so I don't usually stay, I just grab my boba to go.  \n\nThe bubble tea is great.  I rarely stray from my standard black or green milk tea, but here I remember really like the rose petal? or rose-something tea with lychee jelly instead of tapioca balls.  (sorry it's been so long since I've been there).  And they also have mochi ice cream which is YUM.\n\nI always try to stop there on my (now very rare) visits back to Boston!","847":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. This has quickly became one of my favorite brunch spots.\nI have tried quite a few items and all have been awesome. \nI normally order the strawberry orange juice.\nThe staff is friendly and fast. Food comes out so quick it is scary.","848":"Shame on me for taking so long to get here! I walk & notice signs saying, \"Sue says...\" I'm already liking this place. A woman takes my order & I ask if she is the famous Sue. She says, \"I'm Sue, but not I'm not famous.\" \n\nI get a hot Italian. It was perfect. I like the bun a little toasted so it doesn't get soggy with the oil. I'll be back!","849":"Fun hibachi style. Long wait though even with a reservation. Food was excellent. Pricing a bit high. Would recommend if you're not in a hurry.","850":"Nate, the owner, came out and looked at my house prior to the move, just to get an idea of what would be needed manpower-wise. I liked him from the get-go! Great guy, very personable. After meeting him, I knew I'd found a great company. \nI got a few estimates, and most are in the same price range. So just find a company you like, one that gets good reviews about the employees being friendly, taking care of the furniture, etc. WM Pro guys were all that. Got my 1400 sq ft house completely loaded and unloaded into the new house 45 minutes away from start to finish in 5 hours! I was truly impressed. I would gladly call them again for my next move.","851":"Good donuts but for $58 worth of them I wish they could've at least had my order right.","852":"Walked in and this place was beautiful staff was very  friendly, but we sat down  and in about 5 mins we saw a mouse crawl across the floor. The guy at the table next to us stepped on it and a waitress came over to sweeped it up. We read good reviews and we're looking forward to the place but had to leave .","853":"Authentic.  Not fancy.  \n\nKnow what you're going for - Noodles, Lamb Skewer, or Gyoza.  If that isn't what you're looking for, go the Asia Cafe around the corner.  Noodles are fresh, not dried.  some people like 'em, some people don't.  I do.\n\nKnow where you're going - to a noodle house.  Nothing fancy.  There is a good chance you'll be sitting at a card table.  \n\nWhile this is Chinese fare, it is the most authentic noodle restaurant I have found to date - very similar to what I use to enjoy when I traveled to Japan.  \n\nThe pancakes may be a little oily for some palettes but if you know what you're ordering, you'll likely find them to be excellent.  Be careful - they will be HOT.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb Noodles and the broth was excellent.  Fortunately, it was not too salty (something I frequently encountered when traveling to Japan).  While I generally prefer spicier fare, the flavors were excellent. \n\nI would thoroughly like to see more noodle houses - real ones, not chains - in Austin.  \n\nIf you know what you're going for, you shouldn't be disappointed.  But don't try to make it something it isn't.","854":"I've come here for a couple years on Record Store Day and the service is always great.","855":"The room was horrible and the customer service was worse.  To top it off, my car was burglarized overnight and no one even offered to assist with calling the police.  My advice would be to stay away from this hotel and area.","856":"I called to get a toilet unclogged.     After 2 attempted the tech stated I would need a new toilet and he recommended the $1000 fix.   He said in 2-3 days it would be clogged again.    He charged us $227 and asked if he would get 5 stars for his service.    What????   I called to complain about not having value meet the mark of the amount paid.   Customer service called and said they would call back in 24 hrs.   No one has ever called me back.   Awful company!","857":"Awesome happy hour! Good selection of brews. Also, they have a Hawaiian melt that was to die for. Splurged a little and also got their truffle fries. Cleared the whole plate, and left 5 pounds heavier and happier :)","858":"Very friendly employees. The make up artists are very talented. I've had a couple of them do my makeup. I also recommend trying their smoky eyes service. I like to go to Sephora during off hours when it's not too crowded in there. Obviously the no pressure concept is working for them. I also like to support small local stores as well but one of the nice things about this place is you can browse among a lot of different brands and not feel pressured about commissions. They'll make you samples. I also like to buy products here versus some other places because you get loyalty points for doing so.","859":"Next stop on our bar hopping adventure. I had never been here before, the place was super crowded for St.Patricks Day. We waited probably 15 minutes to get in but there was no cover charge so it wasn't too bad. But once we get inside, you could barely walk past anyone without touching the person next to you. I felt like we were at a rock concert in a mosh pit situation we could barely move. Even after all that fighting my way to the bar, it took another 15 minutes before I got the waitress to come and take my drink order. It was such a loud atmosphere I felt like I was screaming my order at her. Only got 1 drink here, too crowded to get to the bar again just to wait even longer. That and it was so hot inside it got to be a little h comfortable after a few hours so we left. Maybe I'd come back but not on a holiday like St.Patty's Day again.","860":"Great tacos for a great price.  And they have a gluten free menu - yay!  The tacos you will want to eat again and again.","861":"The first time I had a sandwich there it was pretty good, just good though! My boss picked us up lunch as there isn't' alot of eateries in this area. Well, I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. The girl that was making it had her hair in her face (not working around food appropriote. style) I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food. I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it's a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! \n\nPS: Wish I didn't have to click on a star...NO STARS","862":"Called a day before to go see a car , took the day off work to go see it , waited an hour for them to find the keys , to only tell me a while after the car was in the body shop getting fixed because bumper was hit. Talked to the manager and he was rude and arrogant, very unprofessional!!!!","863":"My least favorite  of the vape shops i've been to. They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward.","864":"My favorite indian food and beautiful decor. When you want to treat  your self or family to a nice night out GO HERE. LOVE IT:)","865":"I only went in super briefly to buy the sample packs they carry, but I liked how kind and eager to help the owner was.  Fumerie carries niche lines, most of which I've never tried.  I can't wait to come back and get tailored recommendations from the owner!  A must-visit for all perfume lovers!","866":"Total dump that survived off the back of a crap promotions group for years.  The fat door guy is a rude asshole.  I get that working the door on dirty is a shitty job but you don't have to take it out on others.","867":"As we are on a driving trip between Arizona and Texas, and with our dietary restrictions of no dairy, no sugars and no grains of any kind, we search for restaurants where we can have some good protein and veggies.  We picked the wrong one.  We had four in our party, and one of them picked the steak (all full of fat and gristle), one picked a salad, and the greens were wilty, another picked chicken, which was super dry, and then the service was soooo slow.  In this day in age, we recognize it's difficult to find good help, but when you tip 20%, and they make $25 per table, for example, you expect some decent level of service..not this time..we won't be back.","868":"First time eating here. Coffee is 5 stars.. I had a Mocha and the hubby had an eggnog latte. We both ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito that comes with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were bland and dry. I ended up adding some salt and pepper to make them more edible. The burrito was just OK. Nothing spectacular about it. Would come again just for the coffee.","869":"I am definitely no expert when it comes to the French experience but I have traveled extensively to France and can confirm that this restaurant has an authentic flair to it's food & service.\n\nit is a real gem in Vancouver - where the neighborhoods are lined with Sushi joints & Cactus clubs on every corner. Les Faux bourgeois is very charming and quaint, a great place to take out-of-town guests to show them how \"culturally diverse\" the cuisine is in this city.\n\nTips: Try the French Onion Soup, Steak & Frites and Florentine tart. Lastly, be sure to make reservations!","870":"As a native of the New Orleans area, I can tell you that this food is legit! It is delicious and amazing. crowded, but charming. Their biscuits are out of this world as is their home made jam.","871":"This is only a review for the auto shop, not the gas. This is the only place I've been for an inspection sticker. They seem to know what they are doing as I have never had a problem with any inspection sticker. They are honest and all business. I even once drove from Boston because I know I can trust them.","872":"Came in on a Saturday for Lunch to an unenthusiastic hostess who sat us down on an actual bench. The entire tent is filled with long wooden tables and thus it was not a private setting. Atmosphere reminded me of being in a large, festive camping tent, but tinted brightly orange. The dish we wanted was to split the Lobster Mac and Cheese: \n-Portion: Large \n-Cheese: bit \"watery\", could be thicker \n-Lobster: Average portion \n-Was it worth $27 without adding table service? Probably not.\n\nBy the way, if you're looking for a classic Lobster roll, do NOT get it here. I saw several faces of disappointment when the waiter brought them out. These lobster rolls are definitely underwhelming and expensive! Head over across the street to James Hook for a $20 one that will at least overfill the bun.","873":"I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall.  I thought I would give it a try.  Here's how the experience went:  There were 2 people at the counter when I arrived.  One person placed an order and said she would be back.  She walked away.  The other person was not making a purchase.  There were 2 young men working behind the counter.  The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him.  Two more people lined up behind me.  I asked if I could place an order.  The \"front man\" moves to the back and the other guy comes and says \"Sure.  Sorry, we're really busy.\"  I order cheeseburger fries.  The former \"front man\" puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave\/convection oven for about 40 seconds.  He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard.  He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes.  I was conflicted about what to do with the fries.  They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them!  I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall.  Please don't waste your money.","874":"Had my first visit and fitting. Was a little nervous because I have been hard to fit. However, I had a very good experience with Elise and was soon fixed up with what I needed. I will be returning in the future,  when needed . Thanks Elise for all your help.","875":"Simard's in my mind was never designed for daily eating...it was designed for the late night, heading back home from the festive beverage serving establishment snack break.\nThey have a variety of reasonably (cheaply) priced options ranging from pizza rolls to french fries to Roast Beef sammies.\nThis is not the place you go to get dinner...it's where you go when what you need is the greasy goodness.\nI highly recommend it for late night dining.  You may regret it in the morning, but at 1:00am you will be thanking the nice drive thru man for his patience and his speedy and accurate order taking!","876":"Had a terrible experience here tonight, so much so that I'm writing my first yelp review. It started out with the bartender being extremely rude to us for no reason. He made fun of my friend's drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling. When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I've ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager. Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again. The food was even mediocre.","877":"After a review that I made about Spud, I received a week later a reply explaining the reasons why they couldn't provide us more local products.\nIt is due to the terrible weather that we are experiencing. Unfortunately they have to propose us more Californian products as California had been more lucky with he sun than we have been.\n\nI mean what kind of company answers all your question to make sure that you are happy with them ........\n\nSpud.ca, you were already a big favourite of mine, trust me now when I say that you are my hero .......","878":"After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.","879":"I love Meghan. There, I said it.\n\nMeghan's amazing for two reasons:\n\n1. She makes magic with my hair. She seems to find THE color that works well enough to get people saying 'hey, hot stuff'... okay well not quite 'hey hot stuff', but that's the way it sounds to me after I get my hair done. And if I'm thinking about making it short, oh she'll make it short, and give me the confidence to think I can actually pull it off. Which I did, thank you very much.\n\n2. She has the best personality evar. She's seriously such a delight, without being fake. She's totally honest (even admitting her love of questionable 1980s musicians who shall remain nameless). \n\nShe's so fun and I'm thrilled to be able to get a rockin' lookin' do, while having a great time, too. Can't ask for more than that!","880":"My husband and I have eaten here quite often with our family for a special nite out and have gotten take out from here. Everything is always amazing!! I recommend the meatballs, eggplant rollatini, and veal parm. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is parking and wish seating was more comfortable as you feel to on top of other guests next to you. It is very cozy though and the service is wonderful!","881":"I've only tried 1 type of sandwich, and I've inhaled it every time!\nSimply amazing! The prosciutto with red pepper.\n\nPrice: under 10 bucks for a sandwich and drink. \n\nService: Fast and efficient once you get to the front of the line.\nBe prepared to line up to order, they are making the sandwiches as fast as they can but can't keep up with the  droves of hungry peeps. Lunch time is especially busy.\n\nSelection: Italian deli with meats, pastas, sauces, other Italian delicacies\n\nSeating:Theres only 2 outdoor tables so better off going for take out.\n\nParking: Free street parking but not that many spots around.\n\nPayment: Cash, Credit Cards, Debit.","882":"eat the COPPA. best thing ever. \n\nI usually get the mashed potato with gravy as my side and then my bf gets the Boss salad and we split the two plates between the two of us. The coppa is amazing but it's quite heavy so half the sandwich is perfect amount for any foodie person. Trust me.\nService is solid. They do have a 5 drink max policy. \nIf you go there often get the beer card so you could eventually get a mug.","883":"BAD SERVICE\n\nThe food was gross per usual. The potatoes tasted like they were cooked in dirty, rancid oil. Everything else was just bland. AND they gave me gluten-free bread (not all the bread is gluten-free) without warning me that it was gluten-free. I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.\n\nThe server was talking to her friend\/customer\/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1\/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.\n\nShe was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.\n\nThis was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again. It was just a waste of money. I work in the service industry and wasting my money on a terrible experience is ridiculous. \n\nOh, the applesauce was good.","884":"The bar area had a very classic look, with lots of dark wood. The seating was elegant, with wooden chairs and white fabric table clothes. I loved my drink and the bartender was even nice enough to try making a new drink I had heard about. I loved the music in the background, it was at the perfect volume. Definitely would come here again.","885":"I haven't had dumplings in years and I'm eating primarily on the gluten free ones here. They were super good!!!!","886":"I always get a solid haircut Sports Clips. Stylists are friendly and always consistently good.","887":"My wife and I had been looking for a good Central American restaurant for awhile, and we discovered this place a few years back.\n\nThe pupusas are fried masa and cheese with bacon bits, and they make some of the best pupusas I've had outside of Honduras.  Put a little of their pickled lettuce on top and it's delicious.\n\nI also recommend the Yucca plate if you're in a big group, and you can literally chew off pieces of Yucca (similar to a potato with a harder texture) and bacon (real meaty pieces, not strips) for an hour.\n\nIf you like Central American food, I've yet to find a better place in Texas.","888":"Delicious ice cream and amazing prices on Quest bars! \n\nThey have a really good selection of toppings, and the free sprinkles on Saturday are great. Also, I got to talking with the owners and they are very helpful and attentive. Great little find!","889":"You guys would have people lined up around the block if you would just change out those horrible floors to thick squishy awesomeness! (or at least provide super thick crash pads).  Fix the flooring and I personally would bring you five newbs easy.  I asked the staff about it and they said that they've been trying to get the owner to do it for years, but \"he's too cheap\". Reduce the risk of injury and make challenging routes more accessible = more fun, more members, more $$$.  Don't be lame like that.","890":"OMG!  Sooooo good...but don't go here for chicken fingers.....fried shrimp...lobster sauce....although they're really good here this is authentic...HEALTHY for the most part and DEELISH Taiwanese food...been going regularly for about 7 years....the best sauces....around.   Mmm MMM ....greens like Sprout Of Snow Peas.....or Spinach and Garlic.....or Chicken and Garlic.....sooo yummy.   Hot Pots...many, many many more dishes I had never known...and learned by asking the friendly waitresses...what is he eating?     Look around....see what others are eating and try....too many favorites to list here as I LOVE most of the dishes....go explore...enjoy!","891":"Didn't like the marquee sign out front, looked cheap and appeared to be a strip club or something. However, the food was good and the beer was great! Outdoor seating was comfortable! Service was great! Wings were descent, jalape\u0413\u00b1o bacon wrapped skewers were good!","892":"Still a good burger, but the experience has started to slide.  Lot's of signs with rules, limitations, etc.  No more smiling server greeting you in line to get a drink order.","893":"Elephant's contacted me the same day I posted my original review to follow up on my experience.  Wow!  They left a very nice message verifying that the PDX location does participate in ALL of their punch cards, including coffee and cookies.  Also, they said that they're reviewing this with all of their staff, so something like this doesn't happen in the future.  Thanks Elephant's!","894":"Zero Stars.\n\nJust left a bag of quarters 5 minutes ago in the car with $15 in it, went back RIGHT away (within 5 minutes) and they said there's nothing in the car. They also nickel and dime you for every service and use scare tactics to sell their services. Thieves and crooks. Don't ever use their service. They're lucky we have a flight to catch.\n\nUse other friendlier rental car services.","895":"I ordered the chicken and dumplings with string beans.  Both were seasoned nicely. There was a nice serving of dumplings.","896":"Typical beach all you can eat buffet. The lobster and crab legs are obviously the main attractions, and they should be! I'm not a crab leg or lobster connoisseur but they all tasted great to me. The other fish was all a bit over cooked, seemed like it had sat under the light for a long while.\n\nSome of the sides were good including the lobster ravioli and the crab cakes. Definitely try this place out if you are looking for a buffet in the Orlando area.","897":"Delicious cheese steak and Great service. Will def go back. Calorie explosion though, so expect to be FULL and would recommend for hangover.","898":"This seems to be the sixth location in the area and is similar to the Roswell Rd location, but opened end of December 2013 and has a bit more space.  It was brand new and clean (though a few things were still being added) and fairly empty, so the kids roamed around having a good time.  They even had a dance party with a mascot for the 10-12 kids there at the time (I would have guessed they did this only for parties).","899":"this is not real mexican food...watered down salsa with a buncha salt! Cheap but not good. I got tacos and they sucked. sorry but it's the truth.","900":"Lots of cute accessories for the pre-tween girl. Only buy when there is a sale - other wise everything is ridiculously overpriced. \n\nI've always had decent luck with the sales staff. Friendly and helpful.","901":"Like what other Yelpers have said before: What a great hideaway in Central Square! \n\nYelpers can take FOREVER to decide on a restaurant, especially with our star rating, price range, category of food, and neighborhood locale computing in our little heads. I was actually surprised that Jessika picked this place, since she hates Chinese food. But this is different than what you might usually find. The dishes actually tasted more Taiwanese than anything else I've tried before. For a party of five, we had no wait on a Friday night! \n\nShe was quite fascinated with the background of the food in the introduction of the menu. For dishes, we had the Shogo Nurmtak (appetizer) , Chhasha Curry (chicken), Langsha Duluma (beef), Langsha Momo (steamed dumplings), Gonga Deyngo (pork fried rice). All the descriptions and other choices are in menu pages, so be sure to check that out! All in all, the food was very tasty and well seasoned. It is not greasy at all and not the kind of food that you would regret eating afterwards. Darn the Chinese for their unruly occupation!","902":"We tried 3 dishes all 3 were good. Unfortunately instead of coke we got cherry coke. I'm curry there wasn't enough meat. Over all good experience","903":"This place has great service, but I won't be returning for the food. It looks like if you are going for sushi, this place is probably great, however my husband and I went for a simple general tso's chicken and a beef meal. The quality of the beef and the chicken were pretty awful in my opinion and severely disappointing for the price. I won't be returning, but the staff was great. I am sure their sushi is their strong suit.","904":"This is a fairly nice place to go for a special occasion.  The atmosphere is nice and the view is grat.  It also sits at the end of a very nice walk.\n\nThe food is fairly good.  I took my wife here recently for her birthday.  I had salmon, one of their 5 version of it, in truffle sauce.  it came out almost like a fajita.  The onions and mushrooms had the nice fajita consitancy, and the salom, a fairly average piece of it, was placed on top.  The salmon alone was meh at best, but the mushroom sauce and the grilled onions and mushrooms definitely made the meal.  My wife got some opakapaka (which I later learned to some sort of Hawaiian snapper).  I tried a btie and it was one of the better wish fish preparations I have had.  I am a fan of red fish, but not too fond of white fish, however I would definitely eat it the way this was prepared.\n\nOverall a good place for a date.\n\nOn a side note in response to a couple of the reviews I read:  Seriously, who goes to a fancy (at least fancier) restaurant and expect a 24 oz. steak?  When you go to a place like this you aren't supposed to gorge yourself like a fat pig, save that for Claim Jumpers or Mexican.  You are paying for the ingredients, the preparation and the atmosphere.  If you're just looking for some ho-hum food made in a ho-hum manner in a ho-hum restaurant but in large quantities, please go to Denny's and stop soiling the reputation of decent places with your improper expectations.","905":"I wanted a classy experience with some friends on Saturday night and thought that Gypsy Kitchen would be a great place to try out. It's located in Buckhead and is upstairs at the shops of Buckhead. \n\nThere is a parking garage located right beside it and there is an elevator that brings you right to the restaurant.\n\nGypsy Kitchen is a Mediterranean and Spanish influenced restaurant that features many drinks and a wide range of tapas. Great place to grab some drinks and tapas! They have a rooftop as well.\n\nI loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. It felt classy, yet had this Spanish feel to it that made it relaxing. \n\nWe were seating on the rooftop right away and enjoyed where we were seated. We were greeted by an amazing waiter, named Stanford, who made our experience even better.\n\nWe ordered the Rose Sangrias, which were absolutely delicious, and for food, we ordered a plate of Patatas Bravas. They were pretty simple, yet they were pretty good. I honestly think that it was overpriced though. I wasn't completed impressed by that.\n\nOverall, great place to hang out with friends or have a date night with a romantic feel to it. However, it can be pretty overpriced.","906":"The fact they didn't include the \"Famous\" on here irritates me. I was a doubter but, as a beef guy, I must say the best of the bunch. Roll it out rare and tender, 3 way please. Never tried anything else and likely never will. I've tried all the others and while good they simply aren't \"Famous\"","907":"The best $7 you will spend on lunch in the area! Talking about the Gyros..They put some sandwiches to shame. WOW, this thing was:\nFresh..Juicy..Meaty..Yummyyyy\n\nThis little no frills place packs the punch. I went in there after being cooped up inside with a cold and was craving something good. Even though my appetite was lacking, I put that whole thing down and felt great after! \n\nZooooo Gooood!!!!!","908":"The food was great the service was horrible.  Starts from the manager down.  Horrible manner and hostess was so rude!","909":"This is a fairly newer QuikTrip. Located conveniently on my way to the gym. It is nice and clean. Plenty of pumps. There is an entrance and parking on the side of the building in addition to the front. This is a great way to avoid the crowd. Prices are affordable and the pricing sign can easily be seen from the road. They sell lotto here - fyi for the gamblers. :-) The staff I have encountered are nice.","910":"What is a Chinese street sandwich?  Delicious, that's what it is!  Just picture a handmade flatbread wrapping device enclosed with a chicken so lightly fried you almost think it's calamari.  Then add pickled peppers, greens and sauce.  You now have the Chicken Po Boy in your hands.  Eat and enjoy.","911":"I just had an amazing massage by Jessica. If you have any type of pain anywhere she will take care of it ! She also asks questions in regards to what you like an dislike and what you'd like her to focus on. \n She incorporated stretches and seemed to be extremely knowledgable about the body.  I was very happy that she pin pointed areas that needed work. I just booked a 2nd appointment next week","912":"Sadly I don't recall his name but I had one gentleman arrive with a very unassuming truck for my move. It wasn't complicated so I suppose that was sufficient. He was quick and efficient. The fee to move was sensible. I guess they are a new company because there was no branding on the truck and the worker didn't appear to have on a shirt identifying him with the company. He was very kind and even conversational. For smaller moves I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.","913":"One of the best pho places here in Portland!!! The size portion is decent, the soup and meats are in good quality. I just wish I live close by and can come here to eat everyday.","914":"They've changed their menu. They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.\n\n new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  \n\nWhen you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.","915":"My family and I just love this place. We take all our friends out to Blue Fin for dinner; I eat lunch there 2x a month at the counter next to this lovely Japanese woman who probably eats lunch there every day. Food is fresh, sushi wonderful, people who work there very friendly. Not a fancy place , not too expensive, and a gem of a neighborhood restaurant.","916":"The food is good and it was rated A on the state inspection app whatthehealth. \nI wanted to leave a tip but they don't accept them. They say they want you to come back and their excellent service backs the statement.","917":"Clean and nice interior, service was great but food is just ok.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizer, fish cake and crunchy wonton. Fish cake tasted like it's microwaved and the wonton is bland.\n\nFor main we ordered pad Thai and shredded chicken. Probably the best pad Thai we've ever had. The shredded chicken is pretty spicy, if you love spicy food you should definitely give it a try.\n\nWe also had the coconut ice cream, we probably had a big expectation because of the reviews but we think it's just tasted ok.\n\nOverall we had a good time experience but nothing really impressed us except for the pad Thai.","918":"Good frames.  Good pricing scheme.  Lenses included in frame price.  To get my annual benefit for insurance it costs more to use insurance than out of pocket.  Beautiful frames.  Especially like the limited edition frames.   No spring hinges so minus one star.  The suggestion that if you buy 5 you get one free kinda indicates that the type of clientele here isn't really me. For my 2017 benefit you'll find me at target optical. \n\nBut I love the clearish shiny opalescent blue frames.   For that I might up my price point for my 2018 FSA use. \n\nThe doctor is trendy.  Matches the store.  She is honest and kind.","919":"Ok I agree with the other yelper...This place is over hyped.. I had the Roast Beef with mashed potatoes and green beans...Don't get me wrong the food is good..The roast was tender , mashed potatoes were good but they were not anything out of the ordinary.. Lacked seasoned flavor.... it taste like cafeteria food .I also had 2 rolls which were hard .I got an unsweetened iced tea & peach cobbler.. All came to total $11.86 which was over priced for this food. I would think the people praising this place also enjoy Piccadilly & SS cafeteria too because this place falls right in line with those spots....I should have went to Donnies Country Cooking which would have been less & they got baked chicken not all this fried stuff like this place has...so overall I will not come back here just because it was closer to my gym","920":"We really enjoyed this place!\n\nWe each had a curry plate. I had the Tikka Masala and Lawrence had the Korma both with chicken. I got mine at 'medium' spice but I feel like I should've gotten the 'hot' instead. Other than that everything was delish! I suggest the Mango Lassi as well for you mango lovers out there.\n\nOur meal was less than 30$ and we also had an order of Naan bread as well. They also have the buffet option which is $9 per person. We left very satisfied with the service.","921":"I just had my Closet installed and they did not finish the job the day of the installation like they said they would. I had told them in advance that i would be leaving the state in a few weeks so i needed them to have my closet installed before then. They said not to worry that it would be done by the time i left. Well i am about to leave on my trip and they still have not finished the job. I have been calling them almost everyday so they can send someone to finish it but no call back in return. They charged my card with the job not being done, yet they cant call me back or send someone to finish the job. I am so dissatisfy with the company and will NEVER hire them again. This company does not cater to its customers needs and wants at all. I hope you guys wont make the mistake i made in hiring this unethical company who only care about taking your money.","922":"Why can't burgerville get food hot?? New location in Tigard.  This is like the one in Canby.  Same cold food and seems like smaller burgers?? Anyone else?   \nThe place is clean and folks were nice.  \nLots of competitors close by.","923":"This OSJL used to be just ok, and average. Once the Dedham store opened about 5 years ago, it was much better. Now FINALLY the good shipments of inventory and rather well organization have arrived to this location, right off Route 1 past the Dean Street traffic light. If in the area, stop by, otherwise go to the Dedham one. They are both great and equal.","924":"We had Katherine take care of our pup while we were out of town for a few days. We went by her house and met her and some dogs she was watching at the time, and our dog just loved her and the other dogs. She sent us text and pictures updates of how he was doing. He went and played at the park and went on lots of walks. He seemed like he had a great time and came home a happy, healthy and very tired puppy! We are very glad we found Katherine and our pup had so much fun!","925":"Excellent service,food,atmosphere, This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Orlando but a bit pricey but still worth every penny. Reservations suggested if not U will wait for a long time. \n\nFood Quality- (out of 5 stars) 4\nAtmosphere ( out of 5 stars) 5\nService ( out of 5 stars) 4","926":"Eh. Walked in and got a pedicure. $47 for a basic pedicure with gel seems a bit much for me.  Once I got seated, the water was lukewarm. The lady got started right away and turned off the massage chair. What the heck? Halfway through, she asked me if I wanted the paraffin treatment, which I declined. She kept asking and telling me how good it was for your feet. No thank you again for the third time. \n\nThe gel polish and paint job looks descent, though. \n\nWill go back to my standby VIP nails on IH35 and Stasney for $32.","927":"This place has its mix of good and bad stylists. I think 72 (includes tip) for a haircut (above a new talent) is a little steep, but maybe that's just me. The lady I went to did an okayjob, but she cut my hair a couple inches shorter than we agreed upon. However it ended up turning out well and she was very polite.","928":"ARE YOU SERIOUS? they got that beef tartare?!? yessssir, it's pretty delicious. Don't even get me started on the shakes - them shakes bring all the boys to the yard, specifically me.\n\nAll the other burgers are aiiiiiight, I'm not a big fan of putting sweet stuff on my burgers so watch out for that. The environment is pretty tight, they got that dim lighting going on so bring your woman.","929":"We have come here twice and had an excellent experience both times. I work at a fine dining restaurant myself and can speak from experience when I say the service at Eddy V's is the best in Austin. You'll pay a pretty steep price, but you will get EXACTLY what you pay for. The steak is good, but the seafood is some of the best in Central Texas. If it is in your budget, I highly recommend Eddy V's.","930":"Clearly The MLBPA has some taste. I definitely enjoyed my stay here. I came for a trade show and the room was built in to my cost. \n\n I thought everything about the hotel was nice. The room was nice,clean and comfy.  As almost everyone had said the TV in the bathroom was awesome. Not that I would need the TV, but since it was there I made a point of turning it on while in the shower. \n\nWe had breakfast and a working lunch during the trade show. The lunch was so so good. Tons of choices really good chicken and steak. Delicious deserts. Not your typical buffet lunch. \n\nThey have nice piano bar in the lobby, with actually decently priced cocktails. It looks a lot swankier than it really is. But still nice. The food at the restaurants are pretty good. I think they have 4 or 5 restaurants. The pool area is huge too. Top Notch. \n\nThe hotel is also really close to the Pointe, which has a movie theater and tons of places to eat and shop. They even have an awesome comedy club! So you don't have to pay for a cab or Mears to go anywhere. If you're  only in town of a conference or trade show.","931":"So much fun! Perfect summer activity. They have boards, kayaks, canoes, etc. all reasonably priced for the area. Staff is local hs and college kids, but they're super polite and really helpful. \nAnd shocking for Marblehead in the summer... free parking!  Also- they have \"frequent paddlers\" discounts, if you get addicted.","932":"I am very disgusted by what I witnessed at Hooters.  Today I went to Hooters for lunch.  There were at least 15-20 people of Mexican decent that walked in to be seated.  I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat\/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,. I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident. No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are!!!","933":"Best time here out of all of the Hooters...... Ended up with 3 of the girls to go out for drinks with a few friends of mine and they were all down to earth. Good times and good peeps. I recommend getting their porno wings and a pitcher of their coldest.\n\nPorno? eh?\nTranslation: XXX hot=porn\n\nEnjoy","934":"When Qdoba came to Huntington and replaced Stars (did anyone even go there?), it was pretty awesome. The food was fresh and delicious. But somewhere along the way, Qdoba lost it's way and things just aren't the same anymore. Most of the workers there seem incompetent. The food is continually getting more expensive, and the food isn't as fresh as it used to be. It is a bit pricey considering you can get a massive wrap over at Boloco that tastes better and is bigger for less. Qdoba does have some pretty good nachos, but in the Southern US you get these for free with your meal, which really sours the deal here. Qdoba is a place you can probably visit a couple of times a year and not feel too bad about it, but it's by no means great.","935":"i'm a sucker for puns. any one that knows me knows its true. \ni love this place. both times i've gone have been on saturday nights when the djs were playing a sweet mix of mos def, chromeo, old school reggae, and the funky fresh stuffs.\nthe enormous room is a great time. the drinks are decent. i mean, booze in boston is expensive anyway. the bartenders a cutie and the rest of the staff handles the crowd like its no ones business. the only downfall that they have is that it takes so long to get a drink at the bar, that half of the time, my friends are out the door before i can even get my drink. other than that, great lounge, great vibes, great beats.","936":"An incredible dining experience! Four of us had dinner one Saturday night and still talk about the outstanding service and food! Two people in our party have food restrictions. Our server went above and beyond to make sure we had safe meals that were still delicious. Everything is made to order, even the sauces!! I assumed I wouldn't be able to have a pasta dish because o cannot have garlic or onion. The chef was able to creat a sauce just for me! Another person in our party had the gluten free pasta (the only pasta on the menu that is not made in house) and it was REALLY good! The restaurant is small, but very cozy in a good way. It's ideal for a romantic date. Tables are very close together, but once you're seated you don't feel overcrowded. There are only 15 or so table total. Make a reservation! We cannot wait to go back!","937":"AMAZING deal for quality, new boxes. More people need to know about this place! Bought four boxes today - 2 medium and 2 large - for under $7.00!! You can't beat that with a stick! Anyone buying directly from a U-haul is nuts w\/ this place around!  Totally impressed!","938":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Ordered plain tacos today. One Carne Asada and the other Abodaba. Carne asada wasn't great. Meat was mediocre quality and flavor was bland. Adobada was much better with great flavor and a hint of spice. Service was efficient and atmosphere good. Giving it 3 stars for now but will update as I continue to try other items on the menu.","939":"I've been to Gusto many times and it is always great! You can't beat their happy hour. All of their apps and pizzas are so good! We just went their for brunch recently as well and everything was delicious. I got the polenta dish and it was sooooo good. Pancetta was a little salty, but I didn't mind! I'm looking forward to going back for more happy hours and brunches soon! The service is always stellar as well.","940":"Don't get me wrong, I am all for elevating the stature of asian food to chic and trendy, but the food here was uneven. There were some hits, like the pork belly buns and papaya slaw. The tacos were also pretty good. But there were also some misses like the tea smoked ribs and chicken wings. My main objections to the ribs and wings were that they were very salty without being terribly savory. I think that this place could be even better if the owners tweaked parts of the menu.","941":"Quite a noisy establishment. Service is ok but certainly nothing beyond mediocre. There were hardly any vegan options which I found somewhat baffling since this restaurant is located in a very progressive area where many educated  and  health conscious individuals live. The waitress did try to accommodate me and they had 1 entree which is true vegan. But that's it, aside from salad and sorbet. Parking is fairly good. Staff is friendly but in a very robotic and scripted manner.\n\nAfter reading the owner's reply to my comment, I felt I needed to reply. I appreciate the courteous response. I do not agree that 1\/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck.","942":"I had the Pad Kee Mao take-out and it was great. The place was very busy when I went and so it appears to be a popular place with the locals.","943":"Amazing a\u0413\u00a7a\u0413\u00ad! Authentic, fresh, healthy and energizing. Great location near south congress. I suggest the Chuck Norris for post workout or the Over the Rainbow add Avocado. Check them out!","944":"I wish I had read the reviews of this place prior to spending my money here.\n\nI couldn't even distinguish the difference in the rolls because it all looked the same!\n\nDoesn't matter what we ordered, EVERYTHING we ordered tastes the same.  It was a flavorless, bland, pasty mixture that was rolled up in dry rice and topped with fish that could have been mistaken for jerky.  The avocado was more black with hints of green.   The tempura was so dry it was actually chewy.\n\nThis place is awful.  My stomach has reached up and grabbed my tongue so as to never be assaulted in such a way again.  \n\nIn my opinion any positive review of this place has been purchased.\n\nSave your money and your tastebuds and eat somewhere else.","945":"I used to love this place. Just had the most tasteless meal ever.  You could not teal the chicken from the noodles in the low mien. The hot and sour soup was neither.  I don't expect the best meal ever from delivery shop but this sets a new low. \n\nLast dollar spent here!  Go elsewhere.","946":"Wanted authentic Mexican food, small restaurant but still got what I wanted.. Great service delicious food. I ordered the stake with enchilada topped with mole, beans, rice plate. With a chile relleno on the side!! Uuummmm","947":"Everything has always been top notch when we come here. Luis had always taken care of us, and the food is tasty.","948":"Good food, good price, and good service.  You will always find the same staff and enjoy getting to know them.  You can also get in and out quickly if you are in a hurry, or call in a to go order that will be ready by the time you get there.","949":"Super yummy food, but FYI some of it is on the sweet side. The catfish was perfect  with just the right cornmeal to fish ratio. The Mac n cheese was good, so was the cole slaw (condiment for cole slaw was sweet but on the side so you could choose how much). The ribs and pulled pork sandwich were also really good - smoky and substantial with a thick, tangy, almost pineappley sauce. We will definitely be back for more - can't wait to try the rest of the menu!","950":"Portion size is big at this location. The friend chicken nuggets is very good. Fried squid also very good. I also like their beef noodle soup. The side dishes are a hit and a miss. I had lotus root one time and I had to spit it out. I still come very often because of their generous portion size. \n\nThere is usually a long line up on weekends but it's a good place to hang out with friends as they open till really really late. \n\nRecommended bubble tea choice is oolong milk tea with pearls.","951":"We loved VietRiver! We stopped just to try out some Vietnamese food without realizing what amazing vegetarian\/vegan options they had! Super bonus! My (meat-eating) boyfriend even loved the vegan \"ham\" wontons. Everything was SO good from the Vietnamese iced coffee and fresh lemonade to the Vegan Buddha Feast Soup (with veg. chicken, vermicelli noodles, veggies) and the Vermicelli Chicken Bowl. Service was great too. A definite gem! Highly recommend!","952":"Hmmm... I would have assigned a negative star, but the system doesn't allow you to... \nThis place plain sucks... Upper case SUCKS... The food is no more than the average hot dog you get on a street, which is actually more tasteful... And better service... Service...? hmmm, what service...? Much left to be desired... This place is not at all what I had I mind when I think German village... My advice...? Go some place else...!","953":"Imani (bartender) is the absolute best! I was very pleased with all of her recommendations and quite pleased with the drinks she made.  Every time someone comes into to town we make a CowFish stop.  My last guests brought children who were served bento boxes with the cutest rice crispy\/sweetish fish treat on the side. I loved the service as well as the music!","954":"The rotisserie chicken is GREAT and a good deal.  If you come at dinner time they will be taking one right off the skewer for you most of the time. The steak kebabs are great as well. The chicken pot pies are awesome but a little costly, def worth a try.  As for sides I like the mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cornbread. They all taste great but (other than the cornbread) are just a bit salty for my taste, probably not much more salty than most other take out places though. I haven't tried much else on the menu yet,. This place is a good alternative to pizza or Chinese (especially Belmont Chinese places) They have free delivery to Belmont and Watertown.","955":"Vacationed in Maui last summer and this place felt so true to the island! Loved chatting with the owners about our previous trip and comparing their food to the authentic Hawaiian food we were used to. Amazing pork and fish tacos! Love the cool food truck vibe. Only bad thing is the flies around the picnic tables. Other than that, this place is definitely worth the hype!","956":"It was a nice experience. My job took us here for free with the VIP package and we got champagne. You watch a 3D film first before getting on the eye.\nOur tour guide was David and he was good.","957":"This was my first time I visited one of the chain's restaurants.  Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.  This location might not be accessible to handicapped people.","958":"This place used to be a decent Japanese sushi restaurant until the change of owner recently. The Japanese sushi chefs are all gone. The sushi is poorly rolled, standards at this restaurant has dropped. For long time customers like me, we taste the difference.  They think that getting some asian guys to wrap rice in seaweed is sushi. Some traditional japanese dishes are taken off the menu. It is going down the same way as Ginza. Time to find another japanese place.","959":"The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.","960":"South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect.","961":"Soup was too sweet, too much msg, and not hot enough to cook the rare beef.\n\nSpacious but dark.\n\nA bit pricier than other pho places.  I think around $7-9\/bowl.  They only have small or large sizes, not medium.","962":"The owner, Mr. Abercrombie, was very patient  working with my changing schedule.  Our carpet is light in color and has not been cleaned in 10 years and Genesis made our carpet look new!  All of the black spots and stains were removed and the job could not have been better.  Everyone was polite and professional.","963":"Had a great meal at Bartaco on April 12! I took a suggestion from Southwest Airlines' magazine and had a great experience. Really unique flavors and ingredients and a cute, comfortable atmosphere. Be sure to try the wild boar or the pork belly tacos, and the CLT!","964":"We stayed here as a team for my son's soccer tournament.  The only disappointment was that there was no microwave in the room and no washer\/dryer available to wash the team's uniforms.  My husband had to drive to a laundromat to get the team's uniforms washed late at night or really early in the morning.  This was not as convenient, wish they had a washer\/dryer onsite.","965":"I want to give them 4 stars, but the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had there are very specific.\n\nFirst, the good:\n1. Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.\n2. Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\n\nNow, the meh:\n1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey. That seems to be the way of it with good Italian in Boulder. They are not worse or better than anywhere else.\n\nI go several times a year. I like it. The good is way good-er than the bad. It's just not amazingpants.","966":"My favorite place for a quiet romantic dinner or gathering with friends. Excellent food, service and atmosphere.","967":"Location\/Parking- Easy to find and there's a small parking lot. \nCustomer Service: Very friendly staff\nAmbience: Very quaint with few tables, but that's all part of its charm. \nFood: So far, I've tried the pork and beef burritos, guacamole and beans with cheese. All were delicious with lots of filling in the burritos. \n\nI'll be back to try the breakfast and the grilled chicken entree next time.","968":"Good customer service, even on a busy day. Only reason I giving them 4 stars is because of a lack of inventory. \nI was there close to a hour trying to find the right pair of work boots. It was worth the time though. I had narrow my choices down to 2 models of what they had in my size-12. They found 1 of the models with a blemish. I didn't care since they are for work, and it was cosmetic. I walked out happy paying $65 for a pair of $200 boots. \nThis is my 5th pair of Keen boots in 8 years. Great brand, but a little pricey. That is why I am stoked about my new boots.","969":"We have been here several days at Disney World and desperate for a good sit down dinner that wasn't over priced! \n\nThis place is very well priced and is a very nice.  The food was quickly made and very good!  I had the spaghetti bolognese and thought it was great.  My daughters had the kids spaghetti and cheese pizza and they were real adult versions, just smaller so it was also wonderful eats.  We order a half craft of their table red wine.  Also good.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit and prices $10-13 entrees.","970":"Great place to have\/host a happy hour.  We always order from the \"bar food\" menu.  The wings and burgers are great.  Also, try a half order of the lobster nachos.  There are usually good music acts as well on Friday or Saturday.  Parking can be a problem, so get there early.","971":"I had a gel manicure\/pedicure and it was the most perfect thing I've ever had. They take the time to fix any smudges and make sure the polish isn't over the nail and don't rush at all. I'll definitely be back. Also try to upgrade to a deluxe pedicure it will be the most relaxing thing you ever experience:)","972":"Really closer to 3 and half stars.\n\nMy friend and I were trying to go to Esparaza up the street, but they were closed on Sunday, so we meandered down the block to Fonda Rosa.  \n\nAlthough we were seated quickly, the service was incredibly slow all night.  Sometimes I like to have a leisurely dinner, so this isn't always a bad thing...but this was \"leisurely\" to the max.  \n\nThe food was very good.  I got carnitas (the waiter recommended them) and my friend got pollo enchiladas.  The homemade chips and salsa were (which had to be ordered separately) were gobbled up in no time.\n\nFonda Rosa is a bit pricey.  The place presents itself as a casual dining experience, but the margarita I bought was $10 and some of the entrees were over $20 (not all, some).  \n\nThis isn't the best place to just drop in to, but if I were planning a nice night out then I'd probably come back.","973":"The service was very good. We had a large party and most of the dishes were very well made. A few were not spectacular. The appetizers were difficult to share with more than four people because of their presentation. I personally liked Equinox better but I would still go back. Cocktails were great.","974":"I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be.\n\nI called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, \"You ever use Yelp?\" \"Duh,\" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.","975":"This store is great.  They have wonderful sales and the customer service is amazing.","976":"I come here all the time as I live within minutes of this place.. and I love it. The monk who works here is very friendly and makes good suggestions for special treats to eat from the menu. I love that they make all the fake meats themselves, you can literally taste the difference! The salad rolls are super yummy. And definitely try the avocado smoothie- a tasty treat!\n\nI will mention that this is a very laid back restaurant and while the service isn't like a regular restaurant you will not compromise the quality of food. I will continue to go there for a quick snack\/ lunch\/ dinner forever!","977":"The food is great!  One of my fav brunch spots in town.  The service is always awesome, and the environment is welcoming.  A great place to meet up with friends or have a nice date night!","978":"One if the best dining experiences we've ever had. The aroma, flavors and presentation took us back to the orient style cuisine. Staff was so professional and nice starting with our waiter Joe. Every single dish was explained to what it was and how it was cooked. \nMost of the fjord was prepared with locally grown products. We are making plans for our next visit.","979":"Wonton soup was quite strange. Wontons were overcooked. Egg roll had no flavor. Will never order from again","980":"When I stepped in this restaurant for the very first time, it instantly smelled of alcohol!! That raised my concerns about the place. However, have been here twice now and ordered their dosas on both occasions. The dosa was gr8, crispy with 2 kinds of chutney and a spicy sambhar. The potato mash stuffing inside the dosa was so spicy the first time around that my toddler was red in the face. The owner was generous enough to offer complimentary Gulab Jamun to calm the heat :) The jamuns were perfectly soft centered making them melt in the mouth. My husband had a to go order of Biryani on both counts, the quantity is for 2 servings but its still over priced. We tried the chicken chettinadu with nan. The Chettinadu was awesome with nicely balanced flavours, no over powering spices. The service can be be slow on weekends and be prepared to wait 45mins before your order arrives.\nOver all...gr8ly satisfied.","981":"Lunch at 1:30. General Tso chicken had way too much breading.  Hardly any chicken in many big pieces. Good sauce, though. Fried rice was bland too. They forgot the sour in the hot & sour soup. Expected much better from a \"fancy\" chinese restaurant. Boy, do I miss Golden Wok. Eggroll had a bunch of pepper, kinda wierd. Not worth the premium price. Had high hopes. Disappointed.","982":"First off, I'm not vegan, but my girlfriend is so we often eat at vegan places when we go out. I wasn't even hungry but thank god I ordered a vtopia club, and my girlfriend ordered the grilled Mac and cheese. \n\nI made a Yelp profile just to review this place. I just ate the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my whole life. Do yourself a favor and come try it. That is all.","983":"I don't have time to haul over to Allston\/Brighton for Yi Soon bakery, so this is the perfect place for my more frequent visits to Chinatown. In addition to marbled tea eggs, this place also has homemade Taiwanese style bahtzang \/ zhong zi -- sooo delicious, probably  mostly because they are fresh! I also really like their buolo bun so much more than other bakeries' around here -- light, fluffy and the crust is moist and doesn't separate from the rest of the bun. Only tried a handful things so far but will definitely be back to taste more!","984":"These guys are great! We did two resizings - very quick no problems and great fit. I also worked with Phil on a custom piece using an old stone. He was so helpful, had great ideas on what we could do and picked out exceptional accent stones for the piece. Very easy to work with, great pricing and fantastic work. Highly recommended!","985":"I've been there multiple times, usually a man did my nails. This time it was the wife\/owner, she kept saying \"it looks good no\". I told her it looked uneven & all she did was add another coat of polish. There are still large dents & waves in my polish, it looks terrible.","986":"I'm very familiar with Zen Cuisine considering I worked next door to the South Congress location and frequent the Guadalupe location as well, but this was the first time I ate at the Anderson Lane location. It was New Year's Day and we found ourselves wandering aimlessly around Austin very famished. Luckily good ol' Zen was open!\n\nSo this location looks like it could be featured in a Dwell Magazine article. Kudos on the design! Love the modern wall art, hanging light fixtures and wooden beams. I felt properly hipster in there.\n\nOur food was good- like it normally is since they've done the menu makeover- but I don't know if it was because it was a holiday or what, but the staff kind of made me feel guilty for ordering sushi when their wasn't any made. Twice! If that is your trick to get me to tip more, you did an excellent job, sirs!\n\nAlso, the cashier was playing around with his smartphone while it was somewhat busy. Call me old fashion, but wait until we can't see you texting so we don't quietly judge you!","987":"I ordered the chocolate delight cake and the ricotta pie for a work event.  Based on the name and how the lady described it, it sounded like a chocolate lovers dream. It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :\/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.","988":"I walked in early afternoon, and my initial impression was very, very nice.  The salon was clean! The salon owner, Tamara, greeted us right away and was very pleasant.  The nail color selection was smaller, but I liked the fact they had a good selection of O.P.I. and Essie in all the colors that are in style right now.  Tamara did my pedicure and she was very friendly.  She even offered me tips on taking care of my nails at home in between manicures and pedicures!  I liked that she established a rapport with me right away.  By the end of my visit I knew all the ladies and they were all professional.  The prices are pretty reasonable and I like the menu of services that they have.  If you are looking for \"Official\" nail care this is your place. I will be back!","989":"the lobster raviolis were absolutely delicious but my dumb boyfriend was challenged by the waiter to eat a large pasta dish and it was gross watching him out how BIG it really was.\n\nseems like a fun place to take your family for a huge meal.","990":"Nice modern-looking environment.\nMellow music.\nFriendly service.\n\nMost importantly, great food.\nMy friend had the combination fried rice. He loved it!\nI had the combination clay pot and it wasn't bad at all.\nI wish I had chosen my friend's seafood clay pot which looked amazing.\n\nYou have to try out this place. Great eat for the late night munchies.","991":"Good food. I tried the sesame chicken with fried rice and the royal ginger roll. The roll was delicious. The chicken was good. Would have like more green beans to be mixed in and the sauce was a little too salty. But I enjoyed it and would get it again. The fried rice had little pieces of pineapple mixed In and that was great. It made it different from other places and gave it an added sweetness which I enjoyed. I also had the typhoon margarita and it was very good as well. It also had pineapple juice which gave it a different twist. The food took a little longer to come than I though it should (about 30 min.) but it was a Friday night and they were busy.","992":"Lamberts has a great deli but if you purchase the produce make sure to use it within three days.  Same quality as the stuff at Quincy Market.  The outdoor seasonal plants tend to be more expensive than most places.  Pumpkins and Christmas trees are way overpriced.","993":"This was so interesting and fun. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about all of Boston's haunted history and we got to do a little paranormal investigating at the end of the night.","994":"Can you give a restaurant zero stars? Because this was by far the worst Chinese food we ever had. Granted we only split one dish and had egg rolls, so maybe we just ordered something that they do really badly, but it was terrible enough I will never give this place another chance.","995":"Mojo crepes aka when it was \"blue sky\" back in the day. Solid place to boba and crepes and to hang out with friends. I like their original milk tea, however their tapioca balls are usually never cooked right only downfall. Sometimes undercooked and sometimes overcooked.","996":"Divine ambiance. Red walls. Cold ones. Love music. There is no better place in the 'ville.","997":"Went here for a birthday celebration.  Birthday girl got her dinner free.  All menu items delicious and service is the best.  Always try the specials - they are great.","998":"Great drinks at the tequila bar! Cierra recommended awesome drinks! Fast and spunky and she totes loves her gig!","999":"We come here about once a week. Pizza is delicious and the wings are really good too. We usually eat next door at hoplandia which is also awesome. Get the Pizzatna , amazing!","1000":"Very professional and passionate about their work. Great communication and responds very quickly.","1001":"Do not try to get a land loan from these people.  They are so slow and do not care about your needs.  They are very friendly, but take so long and use outdated processes.  Bank of America did a better job in half the time.  They should really thing lean not thing six sigma, you can see it their processes.  Weak.","1002":"This is my second time getting a breast augmentation and lift, the first time was done in Scottsdale, Arizona by a different surgeon. I had such a great experience and am unbelievably satisfied with my results. I am SO happy I decided to go with Dr. Gorin, and his nurse (Christy?) is the sweetest person, I am so thankful for her kindness. Dr. Gorin and his team are literally nothing short of amazing!","1003":"Nice staff. Good burger, juicy. You can order without a bun too. Excellent Bloody Mary.  Clean rest rooms. Overall would go back for Tasty burger.","1004":"awesomeness!!!! Their oreo cakebatter ice cream was to DIE FOR!!! After my first visit I swallowed my pride and waltzed my ass back in there with my head held high and calorie counter back home the very next day lol. The workers are very friendly!","1005":"Nice authentic Mexican food. Doubled checked my food before leaving to make sure I had everything there. Good portion of carnitas and good amount of cheese on the quesadilla. Would recommend for Mexican food. It was ready promptly and would order again.","1006":"Visiting Vancouver, saw this close by to our hotel, kids ordered kids chicken pho\nhusband had the #8 pho chicken, chicken ball and quail eggs (but it only cane with one egg), I had the Cambodian style pho.  Generous with their veggie garnish, also fresh.  Good lean slices of chicken in all the pho.  Quail egg was good.  Cambodian pho was flavorful, but very salty and had definite MSG in it.  My tongue is a bit swollen feeling from salt overload, but I would come back another day and try their vermicelli.  Overall grateful they are nearby!\n\nWent back 3 nights later for dinner and tried their vermicelli with prawns and grilled pork.  So good!  This is what you order here.  Generous portions, well seasoned and tasty.  Good proportions of ingredients.","1007":"Wish I could give this place a better star rating but, just can't. Like other reviews, the lady running this food truck is an exceptional person. The food is okay and more along the line of food you'd get from one of those mobile trucks that goes around to warehouse and manufacturing places honking their horn to signal their arrival (I'm guessing most of you haven't had that experience).\n\nI had the Fritos dish with a sliced hot dog in it. Sour cream, chili, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. Kind of reminded me of when I was young and broke and this is all the food I had so just threw it all together and hoped for the best. It was okay, I just think it wasn't up to par with a restaurant, made from scratch meal (I know, all restaurant meals aren't made from scratch).  Wasn't real impressed with the hot dog itself and I got the impression the chili was from a can. \n\nI'd say this is a 3.5 star place.","1008":"Half Fast has so many options that it never gets old. And I don't think I've ever had a bad sandwich there either. The only downside is it can take a while to get your food, so don't go if you're in a rush. You can try calling ahead, but I've had varying luck with that. They also deliver, so there's that, too. This is usually the place for me and my friends to go on a lazy afternoon to get food and drinks.\n\nThe Strong Islands and Margaritas are great. Just don't drink more than two pitchers of anything, ever.","1009":"K&G has been one of my go-to spots for YEARS. This one in particular has been my spot since I moved to Atlanta in late 2013, and with good reason: great selection of big and tall clothing, and a fucking phenomenal selection of self-tie bowties. \n\nGenerally, I'm stopping here when I need to re-up on anything that I might need to look A1 at work...button downs, suit jackets, slacks, neckties or bowties, tie bars...but I refuse to buy shoes from here...that's not a thing. They haven't failed me yet, and their selection of shirts in the 20 neck\/38 sleeve range is a thing of beauty. \n\nThe only gripe I have? No public restrooms due to construction.","1010":"Hands down the best meal you will have in an airport anywhere. Ever since my 1st visit last year, I schedule extra time in Atlanta airport so I can zip over  E concourse for a bite. Extremely well trained staff that never meets a stranger and will always greet a weary traveler with a smile. Not much of a lay over? You can always call in take-out from the runway and grab your bag of delicacies on the run.","1011":"This place did not have what I would call fresh fish. And thank god I know how to use chop sticks, because my silverware had dried up lettuce on it. Oh, and those fruit flies Yelpers keep referring to? No lie - they're totally there, dive-bombing your food and drinks. The rice was rubbery, which makes me wonder if the spicy tuna roll I ordered had been pre-made and just sitting out turning into an eraser. The Gari Gari roll was just a whole heck of a lotta cream cheese, and the Ninja roll was a disgrace to Ninjas everywhere. \n\nAside from all of this, I'm fairly certain I picked up a stomach bug here.\n\nSorry, Ma Soba. You're a hot mess. You made me a hot mess for days after. I won't be back. Ever.","1012":"The restaurant is warm and inviting. I believe it is run by a family and the decor and atmosphere reflect a family vibe. The owner spotted us as soon as we walked in and was super attentive making us feel right at home. He clearly takes a lot of pride in their homemade food and in helping people navigate the menu while taking time to explain every item to us and make suggestions. Cant say enough about how awesome the service was! Food was some of the best tasting  Venezuelan I have had.","1013":"Boy do I love me some Moe's!  My only complaint is the tomatillo salsa is hit or miss depending on location (and ripeness of tomatillos perhaps?). All other salsas are always spot on, my tacos were great as always, and they were willing to accommodate my mix and match philosophy of taco ordering lol!  Would have been 5 Stars, but the tomatillo salsa was watery......","1014":"Not great :\/\n\nCute atmosphere but food was just ok to me.  Grits had no flavor and the muffin on my Benedicts were soggy.  Also the potatoes tasted like they were cooked in a dirty pan.  Not a fan. \n\nIt looked good though...","1015":"Lilikoi\n\nOnce you find this small storefront you will put it in your internal GPS.\n\nYou aren't coming here for the decor but for the FOOD which is delicious, affordable and plentiful.\n\nThe owners Veth and her husband (terrible with names) are very sweet and welcoming.  I took takeout for the family and was sent home with some delicious extras, bread, slaw, etc.\n\nThe drunken noodles are savory.  Both the tofu and chicken come with plenty of protein and leave you with at least a second meal of leftovers.\n\nI had the pulled pork cuban sandwich and it was delicious.  The homemade sweetbread made it great and the slice of ham was sublime.  It made my vegetarian partner think twice.\n\nWhen you patronize Lilikoi you know you are helping small business owners in the best way.\n\nIf you live in NEP this should be a regular togo option.  If not, call in your order, drive by a few times, find 'em and take home a feast.","1016":"Little hole in the walll place  with just a few tables.  The watress was nice.  The owner was walking around talking to everyone.  Excellent food.   Had the mushroom  swiss burger and fries.  That and iced, total with tip was $13.  I would definitely recommend coming here.","1017":"Highly recommended for food and drinks.  a hiiden treasure.  a bit stuffy.  worth the wait.....food portion on small side, but bursting with flavor.   Most have is the Pork Belly Sliders and Mango Quinoa Salad!","1018":"A group of us were wandering around Boston on a day trip and stopped at Scoozi for lunch. The restaurant was still pretty empty but the bar looked so inviting we decided to eat there.\n\nThere were 4 of us including my autistic daughter. The female bartender couldn't have been better. When she asked my (adult) daughter what she wanted to drink and got no response I explained to her about my daughter's disability she couldn't have been more accommodating. \n\nWe got a round of Noble Pils, and a BBQ chicken pizza and a Blanca pizza. \n\nThe food was tasty, the service was great, the only scary thing was the hike down the stairs to the bathroom.","1019":"There are so many coffee shops in Austin, but Caffe Medici will always be my favorite. Perhaps it's because it's within walking distance to campus, or because the background noise upstairs is just right for long study sessions and coffee dates alike, or that they serve their coffee in proper coffee mugs with pretty art in the foam, I'm not entirely sure. Yes it is expensive, yes it gets super busy, but they make their almond lattes right, and they serve taco deli tacos.","1020":"I joined yelp just so I could comment on the Union Sq. Clinic.  I just came back from my appointment with my cat and I am pissed!  The vet recommended an invasive exploratory surgery for something other vets have said is not necessary.  My cat has already been through a major surgery ( a few years back for cancer), so I don't want to put her through one again unless it was absolutely necessary.  When I asked if there was a less invasive option to see if surgery even would help, she basically told me if my cat got cancer it would be my fault.   Wow!  I will never go back there again if she is still on staff.","1021":"These guys truly are the scum of the earth.  A neighbor of my friends called them on me and claimed that I was parked in her spot.  I was not-- my friends have two spots, and I was parked in one of them.  The driver essentially threatened my friend whose spot it was, and when I told him all I had to get the car down was $42, he told me to \"dig deeper\".  He told my friend, who is one of the most gentlemanly people I know, to step away from the car because he was being \"a smart guy\"...not true at all.  Then, he threatened to drive away, making me pay the whole $129.  Finally we came up with $50 total and he skeptically counted it and drove away.  These are the worst scum of the earth, they're crooked, and will do anything to make a quick buck.  Be very careful if you ever have the misfortune of dealing with these troglodytes.","1022":"Used to be great. But has gone downhill since their growth over the last year. We used to see Dr Katie but then she left. Then were supposed to be with Dr Schwab. Almost 2 years since being assigned to Dr Schwab and we have yet to meet her. I usually have had good experiences there but this last one was the last straw. We saw Laura Montag and she was horribly condescending. I don't accept that...doctor or not. We'll be looking for somewhere else to go.","1023":"When I come to visit my family in Atlanta, Octane + Little Tart Bakeshop and Cakes & Ale are our go-to coffee shops.  We're pretty picky about our food - particularly coffees, teas, and desserts - but Octane never disappoints.  (Neither, for the record, does Cakes & Ale.)\n\nPros:\n-The baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop are truly divine.  The meringues, chocolate\/caramel tarts, and basque tarts are particular favorites.  You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.\n-I'm a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!\n-I'm not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. \n-In contrast to other reviewers, I've found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time I've been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?\n-It's a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.\n-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be \"hipsters,\" unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, I've only been here a few times myself.\n\nCons:\n-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  \n-Most of the tables wobble.\n-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when I'm already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although I've never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!","1024":"I would give this place four stars, but one time someone asked me if I was pregnant here. That is why I gave it a demerit.\n\nOn the other hand, my moh (man of honor\/bestie) used to come here a lot on Monday nights when it was empty and drink dirty gin martinis (yours truly) and Johnny Walker pink (or black whatever) with our buddy Benny the bartender. BTB turned a blind eye when I put the moh's rocks glasses into my oversized bag so that we could continue the party back at our places. They also have delicious food here. The cobb salad and the black and blue wrap are phenomenal. \n\nThe ambiance sucks on the weekends. Would you like another blue button down shirt to go with your Bud Light, sir? And there is always a line on the weekends. \n\nGreat place to drink in the afternoon in the Spring\/Summer time on their downstairs patio, complete with separate bar and 2 plasmas.\n\nxo","1025":"Maybe it was because I was sick when I was there, but this place is just too damned loud. I even went to see a mostly acoustic folk band, and I thought my ears were gonna bleed. You also have to stand the entire time, and after a couple of hours, that can really be taxing on ones body. I felt that the venue, while it does pack a very interesting feel and vibe, is just too small, and too loud.","1026":"I'm fairly new to motorcycling and my first bike was an older Ducati monster. Motocorsa helped me with parts and some long overdue servicing on the bike. One thing that I needed was a new set of tires and I noticed they had a sale on tires. The tires on my bike weren't a standard size and were not on sale. Regardless, Motocorsa special ordered me the tires and gave me the sale price anyway without having to ask. I was very thankful since I was already dumping a lot of money into the bike.\n\nFast forward to two weekends ago, my bike was unfortunately backed into while it was parked and the insurance company totaled it. I went into Motocrosa and Christian helped me look for a bike that fit my budget. He did an amazing job at helping me figure out what I wanted, since the old bike I had isn't made anymore. Christian really did a lot to look for a bike for me even though it is an incredibly busy time of year for the dealership and my budget was low. I didn't expect such great service since there wasn't a ton of money to be made from me but he did a great job! I ended up finding a bike from a private party. Christian was excited for me and didn't make me feel like I made a bad decision by not buying something from him. \n\nI had a great experience at Motocorsa and they definitely have my business in the future. Thanks guys!","1027":"This place is really cool! The decor is interesting, there is a crane inside the dining room! We went for dinner and arrived just after 7pm on a Friday. It was packed. We had to sit at the bar but it was fine. Food is pretty good but I was a little disappointed in the meat, cheese and dip platter. I wouldn't order it again. Hummus and pizza were good. Wine flight was fun and there are 4 or 5 to choose from. They don't have a lot of beer options so for picky people looking for beer you probably won't love the selection. Not very many lagers if you are a fan of lighter beers. Lots of vino ;)\n\nThere is some free parking on the street which is a buns!\n\nI would go back for sure.","1028":"I had been to happy hour here some time ago with some work friends and was pleasantly taken by this joint.  So much so I decided Linda and I should check it out.  Thanks to traffic in this wonderful town, she arrived late to see some friends of mine, so we decided instead to enjoy our time in town and ended up here.\n\nNot in the mood for a full on dinner, plus the bankroll was a little thin, we hit the bar for appetizers and near privacy.  We sat at a little table by the window at the far (as in closest to the door) end of the bar.  For the longest time, read: most of the time, we were alone.  It was nice.  Very nice in fact.\n\nWe split the Queso Fundido and Ecuadorian Potato Cakes, not realizing there actually is a menu for those without the love of meat.  But it was near divine.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Especially for cheese with peppers and other fine additions.  I wanted to take it home and slather it all over... I mean it was wonderful.  Linda loved it as well.  Washed it down with a beer and life was good.\n\nService was, well, spotty.  I think maybe because we were far away, or that our order was pretty plain, the waitress kind of ignored us.  Not in a \"you're not good enough way\" but in a \"you don't even register on my radar\" sort of way.  And to be fair, the isolation was nice - I hate it when servers are over your shoulder every 30 seconds, it annoys me.\n\nI think next time we'll come back to hit true happy hour...maybe even dinner.  Time will tell.","1029":"They were awesome! Me and my sisters are in town for the weekend and we wanted to do something fun together so we went to weymouth nails studio & spa to get our nails done and we had such a great time, we called and they took us right away when we arrived, they did such a great job with our nails and toes  everyone was really nice! I got a pedi and a manicure and it was great! I will totally come back again!","1030":"Tried this nail salon for the first time and had Tammy do my nails. She did a wonderful job... It was a little packed due to the holidays...but everyone was super friendly and nice.","1031":"Good laid-back vibe, and killer fries.  Hand-cut Idahoes dipped in creamy buttermilk, rolled in seasoned flour (this is the trick , I think) and lightly fried...served with a special sauce that could make a grown man weep.  VGS, as we like to say.","1032":"Amazing!! Really, it's an overused word but this spot truly lives the definition out:\n\"Adjective (hee-hee) : Causing great surprise or wonder; astonishing. Startlingly impressive.\"\n\nWhen you think antique store you think older, dingy and cluttered. Not here. This spot is huge, organized and easy to move around in. Each little room is a different vendor and you can feel their theme as soon as you lay eyes on the area. You can check a wide range of who stocks here on their website: http:\/\/adjectivesmarket.com\/category\/dealers\/\n\nThere are tons of employees walking around ready to assist when needed but not pushy in the least. They also take your items you are carrying and place it on the table in the front for you. Great way to keep your hands free and each section organized. The range of decor and fashion is really broad so there is truly something for everyone. Furniture, decor, clothes, jewelry, maps, lamps, shoes, wood, tin, glass, so much awesome stuff. \n\nMy favorite were the abundance of wall decor, broach art, wood furniture and old windows and so many owls! I saw so many various pieces for myself as well as fabulous gift ideas for all sorts of occasions. I purchased two things for myself on this visit as well as two gifts. \n\nSuper packed on the weekends but still fun to go, however, if you want much less of a crowd, hit it up during the week. \n\nTruly Amazing!","1033":"Came off a flight from Newark NJ and went to a paint and wine activity. After that we were starving so we ended up here. This was my first time. I liked that when you walk in not only is there a retail section of glasses and other things but there is a bar where you can do tastings. Also a bakery section in the back. It had potential. \n\nWaited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender. My friend ordered the wild mushroom and chicken risotto. The risotto was very tasty. Got to try the ooey gooey butter cake and it was so good. Ha everything was so good ! I would love to come back and try more things. The lobster bisque soup was calling my name.","1034":"This is one of my favorite places to come eat. So far everytime i've been here the waitresses\/waiters has been on their A game. The apps are good esp wings\/hummus platter. My favorite sandwich is the BLT but there was just a little too much tomatoes inside. Recently i also tried the egg sandwich lyonnaise and i was in love! It's a good place to come and grab something to eat. I love their late hours too!","1035":"Hello fellow yelpers!\nI use yelp all the time and this is one of only two times when I think that a company's ratings were gained dishonestly. Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money. When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company's neglect to find them, he ignored my request. Do not deal with these guys. I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase.","1036":"I stopped by this place to get some coffee and pie the other evening. I like the decor a lot, it's very warm and feels very nostalgic. They have alcoholic coffee drinks for $7, but they were running a special on one that was $5. I believe the slice of pie was $4.75. I had the chocolate, which was so rich I couldn't finish it. They seemed to be quite busy, with a mixed crowd of old & young. The staff was friendly for the most part, over all it was a good experience.","1037":"It's an underground dive bar. It is what it is and their proud of it. I've only been here for parties and wrap parties for productions but not voluntarily. I had basic drinks but not really the spot to eat. Outside of private parties, this isn't the place on my high list to hang out.","1038":"Good carwash, they hand dry with towels. Helpful and friendly staff. Make sure you fold in mirrors if possible because brushes can be rough ! Unlimited carwashes for $29\/month is a good deal! (Rough of one basic wash is $15)","1039":"There are two kinds of people in this world: those who wear white with complete confidence, and then there's the rest of us, who have to make an ACTIVE effort not to look like a an 7 year-old spattered with random shmutz by the end of the day. I, being a member of the latter team (read: clumsy), did not do well here. In my defense, it was my first time. \n\nA little background first. Personal shortcoming- I suck at chopsticks. I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.\n\nMy dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. \n\nTruth be told, I just wasn't into it. I don't see myself trying this again.\n\n*If you like this style though, I am told that this is one of the best Shabu spots in all of Boston!","1040":"We went here on Halloween night.  I know, I am so cool for bowling on such a sweet holiday like Halloween but anyway...  I wasn't really impressed.  It looked nice and the servers were ok.  But it was super expensive!  I mean, I love the idea of drinking beers whilst bowling and making an idiot of myself, but I certainly do not want to pay $18 a game!  I even asked if they had some sort of package deal and all I got was a blank stare.  Ugh!  I probably will not be back, but I do still love bowling.  I wonder if there are any places in the 'burbs that serve beer and have bowling....????","1041":"As other reviewers said, this place is best known for its tasty cocktails for good reason. \nWe also had the halibut and pork tenderloin entrees. The halibut was pretty good with some type of zucchini cake\/patty below. The tenderloin was tender, but a little dry. It was stuffed with bacon, carrots, and celery and served with grilled creamed corn, which was delicious. The polenta cake seemed out of place and did not really add to the dish other than a stomach filler.\nFor dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was icy and had chunks of salt in it, which I did not like. The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again.\nService was a little slow even though we were 1 of 2 tables for the majority of our meal. There appeared to be only 1 waitress, but we did arrive in the 5 o'clock hour.\nIn conclusion, great cocktails, OK food.","1042":"I took a friend out for a birthday dinner here on Monday (1\/29\/18) and our reservation was at 9:15pm and we arrived a tad bit late at 9:20pm (Downtown Parking). But despite being late we were welcomed and seated right away, it was a Monday night so they weren't incredibly busy. Because the restaurant closed at 10pm, I thought for sure that we were going to get sub-par service (bad experiences) and that who comes in 40 minutes before closing look but the service was great and the food was even better. I highly recommend the grove to anyone looking for a good downtown Italian meal and an extensive wine list. Will for sure be back!","1043":"This place has great breakfast and dinner. I've been here twice and the only complaint is that the service could be better. The food is so so good. Their pies are the bomb. The only bad experience I have had was last night when they forgot to give me fries with my take out order and I didn't realize until I got home. They are giving me a free meal next time.","1044":"Food was great, music for the belly dancer was deafening.","1045":"A disappointment. The food was lackluster at best and the service was terribly slow.  I wouldn't go back even with a Groupon.","1046":"Very cute theme this place has...the yuppies love this kind of faux retro decor & merchandise.  I've stopped in here on occasion to grab a coffee and\/or snack.  Their baked goods and offerings aren't exactly destination worthy but they're not bad.  The coffee is affordable and palatable to my coffee tastes, but not loving them offering Stevia as the only sugar substitute option.  The community seating around large rustic wood tables is alright, as long as no one bothers me...community tables do not mean I have to talk to you, unless you're cute of course.","1047":"I have had lunch here a few times (including today, still digesting) and I have liked it well enough each time.  I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  \n\nToday I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.\n\nSome posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal \"small fry\" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with the U-Bowls and entrees from now on, but I'll be going back to UFood","1048":"I could easily recommend the Jinya #3. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding. We ordered two $1 sides of them. The (free) side of hand-pressed garlic was also a novel feature. We'll definitely be back. In fact, this place could easily become our new go-to place for Ramen!","1049":"Fun colors, relaxing environment and great attention to detail! Ryan took his time and filed every nail to squared perfection. He used high quality glosses for my manicure and was an extreme professional. Need your nails done in downtown Portland? This is the place!","1050":"I've been using this Discount Tire location for many years and for my last 3 vehicles. These guys are absolutely top notch in what they do and also accommodating for my previous and current vehicles which are lowered. They do proper work in a prompt manner, and there's even a window where you can check out your vehicle getting worked on. Their services are plain and simple: tire installation, rotation, tire pressure check, wheel balancing and flat repair (that means no alignment or check engine services done here). The technician pulls up your vehicle right outside the store entrance and recaps you on the work done and any reminder(s) for the next service, and then you're good to go. In addition, the waiting area at the store is pretty decent with good A\/C, clean restroom, comfortable chairs, available coffee and magazines (if you want to grab food or drink, there's a McDonald's next door as well as a Wal-Mart).","1051":"Life savers! My phone was dropped and shattered. Insurance replacement value was a rip off and would take a week. Called these guys and dropped it off. Had my phone back good as new within hours for a reasonable price. So lucky to have this place on the Westside!","1052":"I try to choose carefully to find a reputable company and I chose Austex Sprinklers because of the amount of great reviews in Yelp.  They did not disappoint! The tech who arrived at my place was  Frank M.  He was awesome! Very nice to speak with, extremely helpful and educational on a few items. You could tell just be speaking with him that he is a good human. :)  It was clear that he had my best interest in mind when we were talking about the related sprinkler issues. I will not hesitate to contact them again in the future and I will be sure to tell anyone I know about this company.","1053":"This chevron never has receipt paper in their machines.  I always have to go inside to get my receipt which is super annoying and a waste of my time.   Lazy workers who won't get off their butt to change the receipt rolls at the pump.   I am going to give my business to another gas station next time.","1054":"Here's the dirt:  Dropped in for lunch.  Ordered sushi roll combo C ($9.99).  You can choose 2 rolls from about 8 different rolls.  I chose spicy tuna and spicy salmon.  The combo comes with miso soup and a drink. The miso soup was standard, slightly more salty but these things vary day to day and I would rather have more salt than less.  The sushi arrived with 6 pieces of each roll on both sides of plate with an adequate amount of ginger and a not nearly enough amount of wasabi in the center.  The wasabi was decent.  I've had better, but I've had worse.  Of course I know it's not real wasabi blah blah blah.    The rolls were loose, contained more avocado than fish, and none were spicy.  At all.  They must have forgotten that part.  The tuna (usually red) and the salmon (usually orange) looked so much alike that even the waitress asked if I needed help telling them apart.   Service was friendly enough.  The dining room is clean and the music was some weird circus tunes. Nonetheless, I was pretty disappointed today. I should have gone to the HEB and bought their sushi to go.  You get fatter, more flavorful rolls for half the price.  Yeah, I said it.  I eat HEB sushi rolls.","1055":"Ordered online wedding invitations. Cheap, easy, and the final product looked fantastic. THANK YOU!","1056":"checked out Symphony 8 + Siensa + Prohibited\n\nFood is eh, nothing special. Had the Mamacita burger, needs more flavor. Uburger still better.  Will return to try tater tots, other entrees though because everything is reasonably priced.  Big tvs is one section, and at the Siensa bar.  Something for everyone!\n\nIt's new, clean, and big place.  Prohibited (the underground speakeasy) is pretty cool.  Love the big couches, good place to chill.  Cheesy christmas lights and mounted game head make it a laidback scene. This would probably be 2 stars without Prohibited.  Worth checking out, great addition to symphony area overall though.\n\nFood (5\/10)\nService (4\/5)\nAtmosphere (4\/5)\nValue (5\/5)","1057":"Great spot to grab a drink from and chill in the park across the street \n\nPros:\n- Love how they grind the fruits and veggies right in front of you\n- Place is simple and clean\n- Gigantic menu displayed on top (they're actually in a font size you can read without squinting, which is a major plus) \n\nCons:\n- Pricey - $5.60 for a 16 oz \n- Place is tight, you can enjoy your food\/drink in the park across the street","1058":"Awesome cheap food with good service. I always come in with a large group and the server expertly handles us and is very efficient with splitting checks.  Perhaps the service is better at  the late hour  we usually come, but I still have had an enjoyable experience at other times. My only complaint is that if it's after 11 you have to pay for parking.","1059":"Had them come out to clean and startup my pond this season and the results were amazing!   Jeff came out to give me a bid and next thing I knew he was able to get me on his schedule. Got it cleaned and the young man who cleaned it gave me suggestions for eco friendly ways to keep it algae free as I have tadpoles every year. Still looking great. After it was cleaned I noticed it was loosing water. Even though it was several months after it was cleaned I contacted Jeff and again was put right on the schedule. Came out and found the issue immediately. The pipe that returns the water to the upper resivour had gotten bumped and was loosing water from there. He fixed it right away at no cost. \nI plan on having them out yearly for startup service and any issues I may have. Wish I had found them 10 years ago when it was built!!","1060":"The main thing this place has going for it is the local feel and the friendly people.  It also is a good value ($ to Food quantity).  Being cost effective is good, because they don't take credit cards.  These definitely are things I look for, but can't move this place up to the \"Yeah, I'm a fan\" level.\n\nIt has cozy in the name, so that is a hint...this place is small.  It doesn't have to be small to be cozy, but this place is really small.  I'd imagine there is a wait during busier times.  We were there on an off time and didn't have to wait.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and did a great job.  The food was acceptable, but not \"I'd go out of my way, to eat there\" good.  I will say the blueberries pancakes were huge.  I asked about the corned beef hash and was told they don't make it there.  Not wanting to eat heated up corned beef from a can, I went with the special eggs, bacon, homefries combo.  It was good, but not better than you could get at most any breakfast place.\n\nIf I were in the North End looking for a brunch spot, and there wasn't a wait, I'd revisit.  But I wouldn't go out of my way and I wouldn't be expecting anything beyond a standard breakfast.","1061":"Ayyy order the Black Cherry w\/ soft serve vanilla-it's hella good! I ordered it togo & the worker made that $h!t pretty fast! I'm about to go back there tomorrow again ha ha.","1062":"We went twice while visiting Portland. The omellettes are incredible and I'm sad now because no other omellete will ever be the same! The whole wheat french toast was just average but I'm not sure if its the fault of the restaurant or the fact that whole wheat bread does not a good french toast make. BUT what sealed the deal and makes me love Bijou forevermore is there oatmeal pancakes. BEST pancakes ever. I am craving them as we speak. If you go to Bijou make sure to try their pancakes. I heard the buckwheat ones aren't as good, but the oatmeal? TO DIE FOR!","1063":"I rarely go to this supermarket coz the parking lot is sucks!!  RBC Bank, Chapters, few restaurants and Starbucks all in this mall.  If you like to see how lucky for the day or test your patient, just try it out.\n\nCoz I needed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at Neptune Seafood, therefore, I arrived 10 mins early and shopped around City Fresh Market.\n\nIt's a medium size supermarket, they have fresh vegetable, live seafood and fresh bakery shop.  I don't really like it personally coz I don't they are clean and foods are not fresh enough.","1064":"Excellent customer service! \n\nThe key lime pie is delightful! That's a high compliment coming from me as I was used to fresh key lime pie in the Florida Keys. \n\nI enjoy coming here and wantes to explain why I gave 3 instead of 4 stars. Its because of the lack of consistency with portions. I ordered a salad meal and it was such a small salad! It cost a full meal price so I was expecting a large meal size salad. The salad IS delicious though!  This was was more a side salad with a bit of shrimp\/bacon crumbles. For what it costs for a salad, portions much to small. I was still hungry after :(  \n\nI will still come back but I sure hope the salad portions increase to meet the cost of it!","1065":"the staff make this place. love them all.\n\nalso love the bacon! and the egg and chive and cream cheese scramble!","1066":"I don't know what took me so long to finally check this place out, but I'm glad I did.  I'm a fan of any place that has games and drinks and decent food and Thinking Man hits the spot.  We had the potato rounds and edamame, all yummy, and played Apples to Apples over a few rounds of drinks.  Their mixed drinks are unique and tasty, and my husband enjoyed a few different beers (until the next morning.)  \n\nI'm mad we had already eaten dinner because the TLT sandwich sounds too good to be true.  We are planning another night there soon to try it out!!","1067":"Best Thai in Austin! Correct me otherwise...\n\nAfter visiting Thailand, I'm a real sucker for Thai food, but I'd say Titaya's is loads better than the other Thai restaurants I've been too in Austin. I'm a serial meal repeater, namely that Gang Penang Curry. I could seriously just put that in a cup and drink it up.\n\nPad See Ew- MUST get eggs with it. You'd be making a horrible mistake not to. Trust me, it helps make the dish.\n\nAside from the awesome food, the service is good compared to a lot of Asian restaurants (ahem, pho restaurants?). I've never had a complaint with the service, and lord knows I've been far too many times.\n\nIf you don't want to believe me, then trust my Thai and Sinaporean friend who also agree that it's the best Thai in Austin ;).","1068":"I consulted yelp for the best watch repair in Vancouver and this seemed the best, despite it's location. After walking past it I realized he's in the post office there. He has enough room for a chair and very small work space. He did some testing and determined it was just my watch battery which he replaced. It took 5 minutes and $5.60. I'd go there again.","1069":"This place is nice and all but not my type.  It is a fancy place, great for going out when you wanna dress up and look posh.\n\nPros:  Good food,\nCons: Can be pricey,","1070":"Maybe 2.5 stars, if I can do that.  For what it is, El Chilito's not too bad--if Mi Madre's is closed (it generally closes at 2pm), then El Chilito will suffice in a pinch.  Their cochinita pibil is pretty tasty, as is their tomatillo pork.  Their barbacoa, unfortunately, tastes nothing like authentic barbacoa.. it's dry and chewy and not even shredded, wtf?  Their breakfast tacos with chorizo are light on the chorizo and heavy on the eggs.  I believe they use El Milagro tortillas, which means they're very good tortillas, but I think El Chilito either lets them sit around too long or doesn't soften them up somehow before slapping the fillings in.  Probably both.  The last tortillas I got there had very dry, stale edges which is a pet peeve of mine.\n\nThat said, ordering a cochinita pibil, a tomatillo pork, and a glass of sangria is a cheap, tasty, and effective hangover-helper... so props to El Chilito for that.","1071":"Service is terrible\nWe ordered little amount of foods and it took 45 minutes to come in.\nWhen we asked for water, she stared at us saying she doesn't have any water badly.\nWe asked to give little more side dish like Kimchi because they gave like 3 pieces of Kimchi. But they said to buy it.\nIn most Asian restaurants,they mostly refill any side dishes you want.","1072":"First time here and it was excellent! Food was delicious, I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and I've never tasted anything like it. Our server was amazing at taking care of us. I'll definitely be back in the future.","1073":"This is the best it's gonna get in Austin! I came here twice in 3 weeks due to the impeccable, friendly service and bomb ass Korean Fried Chicken (KFC)! College Roadhouse is owned by a super nice Korean couple who made me feel right at home. The owner quoted me the weekday karaoke room rate on Saturday, but he still honored the cheaper price ($15 vs. $25)! \n\nBoth times I came here, I rolled up with a large group and ordered at least 10 bottles of Soju and two KFCs. We usually stay for at least 3 hours, and I only spend around $27! For enough alcohol to get me tipsy and dinner, it's one of the best bargains in town! We usually get the KFC chicken with the sweet and spicy Korean sauce and buffalo sauce, and both are delicious! \n\nThe karaoke room has a good selection of English songs. I don't quite understand their karaoke grading system, but it's fun to predict your final score. One of the mic keeps fading in and out, but it wasn't terrible. I will say that I wish they played the correct music video with the English songs we chose. \n\nI'll most likely return within the next month!","1074":"All i've had so far are the tofu soups, but they are outstanding and affordable and keep me coming back again and again.  If you're lucky you'll be in a spot where you can watch the kpop music videos, so fun.  Yum, i'm salivating just thinking of those delicious soups.","1075":"I really liked this restaurant!  I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad with pretty low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken actually had some kick!  The lettuce pieces seems unusually large to me but other than that it was really good.  \nOur server was great as well.  I would definitely go back!","1076":"This place is great! Been going for about 10 months and honestly the food seems better just within the last couple months. YUMMMMM!!!","1077":"I blew a plug with space heaters in my office.  Jack came out the next day, took a look and installed a heating system within 24 hours.  I am warm, no business interruption.  Jack's a pro and has the resources and smarts to bring you the best service at the best price and his timing is impeccable.  They are all about service and getting to you quickly.  They worked their butts off, cleaned up, and I am super happy.","1078":"I had heard so much about this place working downtown in Bev, and had only been in for drinks, so my husband & I tried it. We ordered a bottle of champagne and calamari to start. The calamari came out looking delish, and we dug in. Only 3 small pieces in, we are both fishing around the plate of the hot pepper rings that came with it, looking for calamari, since it all looked the same and blended together. That was it. Three tiny bites and no more. I was really disappointed. On a seperate occassion, I complained to the chef about it and was promised a calamari plate on the house...come to find out he doesn't work there anymore : \\\n\nWe ended up sharing the GIANT seafood stuffed lobster that night as our entree, which was excellent. No complaints on that one, as it made up for the stingy app.\n\nThe service was alright. Our waitress didn't check up on us as much as we liked (or needed). And I must say, one of the bartenders has quite an attitude everytime I've been in. Not only with her co workers, but towards me and other patrons for absolutely no reason either.\n\nOverall, I like the dark setting and cozy feel of Mandrake, and I would probably go back for after work drinks, but definitely not for dinner.","1079":"After complaining about being home sick for my mom's latin food a friend suggested I try Arepa Mia. I was satisfied with my first meal but after subsequent visits I've realized its kind of subpar. Definitely a great intro to Venezuelan food and if you're a college student looking for some flavor in your food its a good fix. Great place for casual lunch. Some tips: this location is tiny! Empanadas are not that good but their black bean\/ plantain one is super yummy and a great vegetarian option.","1080":"I grew up on hot pot, so I am easily disappointed.  Came for dinner on a Mon. night.  It was surprisingly busy.  My primary complaint is that service was slow and inconsistent, but the quality of meat and the lack of feeling pressured to eat and not linger was far better than other hot pot places in the area.","1081":"This place is delicious! I work right down the road and stumbled upon this place. The service is awesome and the staff is super friendly. I went during lunch on a week day and they seem to have a lunch rush. You are seated pretty quickly and if you order pho it comes pretty fast. My boyfriend ordered the small brisket pho and added meatballs to it. He said it was delicious! They add tons of meat in there. The small bowl was plenty for him and he even took some home!\nI ate one of the rice bowls that had pork slices and roasted poems skin. Their savory sauce is delicious! A little sweet and the consistency of BBQ sauce. Loved it. My plate was delicious and also a bit big. Will for sure come back to try other things.","1082":"Great spot for a quick breakfast or a lovely salad lunch. The owners are awesome and they run a great little cafe.","1083":"I need to come back here and try the buffet.  Unfortunately we went somewhere else for dinner which wound up not being good so we needed dessert we knew would be fantastic.  Our waiter was Mike T and he had a great personality and was very speedy.  I ordered Vanilla Cream Puff, which I didn't really need....but wanted.  I also ordered a Mint Hot Chocolate which was such a scrumptious way to wash it down with.  Boyfriend ordered slice of German Chocolate Cake with side of ice cream and he ordered Hot Buttered Rum.  There was a 2 man band playing accordion and drums which was a great way to unwind after a disappointing meal elsewhere.  I did walk around the buffet on my way out the door and it looks sooooo good.  We will absolutely, positively be back and hope Mike is our waiter then!","1084":"Definitely worth a visit. We were looking for something to do on our last day in Boston and so glad we came . We have a 13 and 16 year old and they too very interested and enjoyed it. We spent a little over an hour . Defined catch the movie before you start your tour.\nMy one complaint have been to other presidential libraries and children under 17 free feel that should be here too it would make it more affordable for all families we want to educate our children","1085":"Horrible service, I had to repeat my order multiple times and the people I was with didn't get their order. The server left \"early\" so our table was left to no one. Taking my food to go next time.","1086":"Horrible service. I was with a corporate group, ties and jackets, and we were placed at a large round table. We saw our waiter three times - took our orders, brought our food, and when we requested the check. Some salad plates, including mine, were at the table when we were leaving. I did not get my water refilled.\n\nI ordered the eggplant parmesan, and it was rather tasty, but it was a 3\"x5\" slab on a plate with a light red sauce. No side pasta, no nice mozzarella topping. It looked like it went from the freezer to the plate. It tasted average.\n\nThe decor was beautiful (+1 star). It feels like you're a cast member of the Godfather, minus the bullets.\n\nWould not go here again, not even for a biz lunch. I would rather go to Vinny T's!\n\nThe manager (guy with the tie) even came over, and asked how everything was. I didn't have the heart to tell him he should fire whoever our waiter should have been. I'm polite when I go out, especially among coworkers.","1087":"Was let down on the quality. They didn't cut my nails even though they used the clippers. They didn't buff them at all even when asked nor did they cut back my cuticles. They aren't cheap either. Very friendly nevertheless.","1088":"I've brought my car here a few times now, and I will say that I like the service I receive, especially for my money.\n\nThe actual wash itself is great, but where Scrub-a-Sub really shines (no pun intended) is in the additional services that they provide. Having a team of three guys tackle your disgusting car at once is excellent. One goes to town on shampooing and cleaning the floor mats. Another is busy vaccuuming out french fries from Wendy's, McDonald's, AND Burger King. The third is busy cleaning the dash, windshield, and other interior panels. The cleaning goes like clockwork, and usually, it's done in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe only downside is that if you choose to have the additional services done on your car, you may end up waiting for a bit of time. They service only one car at a time, and if they're busy, you're going to wait in line for them to get to your car, and that could end up being a long wait, depending on what the other people in front of you paid for.","1089":"Checked in about 11pm. I had room on first floor my other family in 3rd floor. Hair all over my sheets. Everything from long hair to straight hair to pubic hair. I was exhausted. Last thing I wanted to do at midnight was remake a bed. Went to front desk it literally took forever for her to find me \"clean\" sheets. Went back to room and \"clean\" sheets then had blood or feces on them. I was so disgusted I should have slept in my car. Instead I took the one clean top sheet and slept on top of that. All the hallways reek of cigarette smoke! The rooms were non smoking yet had ashtrays! The next morning I'm getting dressed and see blood or feces or something smeared on the wall by bathroom! Will never ever stay here again. The night front desk agent was nice but morning front desk was extremely rude! She was standing on her cell phone and completely ignored me until I asked her if she wanted the room keys. Her reply \"I guess since you already walked them all the way here\" SMDH","1090":"My family's go to place for hot pot in Chinatown is Shabu Shabu so was looking forward to mixing things up by going to Kaze Shabu Shabu. Kaze Shabu Shabu is on the edge of Chinatown and is in a distinct purple cube. A friend had gotten reservations for five of us on a weeknight though upon entering it didn't seem like they were needed. We sat at a booth which were comfortable though the backs of the chairs were thin (kids were sitting right in back of us and kept kicking the seats). The service was friendly though sometimes a little slow however the menu is quite extensive. I am use to just choosing from two or three broths but they had probably about three to four times that. Also they had a lot more beer and drinks to choose from but no smoothies. I settled on the tom yum broth ($3), seafood deluxe with udon ($18) and a hot tea. The tom yum was delicious but spicy and the seafood deluxe had a nice assortment from clams and squid to salmon and fish balls though I kept wondering if these were fresh (there was still some ice on the seafood). I was stuffed by the end and felt that the experience and price were reasonable so I think I would come back here again.","1091":"The staff is attentive and I always seem to find a seat for lunch or dinner. The chicken satay is decent but looks like Polynesian warfare and try staying away from the mushroom appetizer, reminiscent of a Wolfgang Puck's concoction diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. The white wine sangria is not bad, but the bartender is a little too trigger happy with the peach schnapps. \nDo try the much simpler grilled shrimp appetizer on a bed of arugula or one of their pizzas - I'm partial to the Parma....","1092":"I have never gotten food poisoning from this location but the food has looked questionable on more than one visit. I no longer eat here.","1093":"Pretty darn good brisket! The self-serve style sides and desserts made it a little too easy for me to over-indulge... Resulted in some tasty leftovers though! Loved the great selection of shiner beers and Texas decorated interior. My only complaint was that the brisket was a little dry for my taste, but the lick-your-fingers good BBQ sauce certainly helped make up for that.","1094":"The remodel has made for a fancy-er Produce Row. The patio is really nice although a bit noisy. Nice draught selection. Love the Beer & Whiskey Pairings! We didn't get a chance to eat, next time!","1095":"Delicious coffee in Austin. I'm a coffeaholic and this place was great. Very hipster atmosphere which is great. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm back.","1096":"A basic standard mall which has been improving over the years. Two floors with the food court and restrooms on the second floor. It's a very clean and simple mall.\nA lot of the usual main stores you will find at any other malls. Food court is decent with the main mall foods. There are a few restaurants attached to the mall such as Outback Steakhouse and a newly opened Trago Mexican Restaurant. There's also a pet store in the mall where you can see or purchase puppies, kittens, bunnies, fish, etc. \nA big kids play area right near the main entrance. There's a library on the second floor. The Cinetopia is also inside the mall which was just newly added a few years ago. A new Gold's Gym will be opening where the old Nordstrom use to be. Good seating area around especially by the Starbucks and Teavana is a big open area. Pretty much all the major phone services has a kiosk here.\nDuring major holidays like Christmas, Santa Claus will be there to take pictures. \nBad thing about the mall is that there is no wifi throughout the entire mall. When they renovated the mall few years ago they took out the escalators\/elevator from the middle and now they are on both ends of the mall. I guess it's a good way to make people walk the entire mall to go up or down but sucks when you know where you want to go and have to walk farther than you have to. After school time you will see a lot of high schoolers who hang around here. \nIt's a good place to walk and window shop but the small size of the mall and lack of stores can limit your exploration.","1097":"Have ate here three times. Every time, food has been delicious and service has been excellent.  No complaints. Their sushi is amazing.","1098":"Not happy with this location, I would recommend the Ashford Taco Mac location.  I had some bad experiences at Taco Mac on Main St. and last night was one of them.  A simple order of wings to go; ordered by phone.  I arrived at the location 10 to 15 minutes later and was presented with my bill.  I paid the bill and provided a small tip.  Waited, checked, waited, checked, and 40 minutes later still did not have my order.  The bar girl was rude and looked the other way when I asked her about it.  The bar man came over and asked what I needed, I stated I had already paid for a togo order which I had been waiting for and checking on with him??  He checked again and still no order.  Finally got a manager and asked for my money back. Nothing free.  Nothing extra.   \n\nJust wanted some wings, but choice of location was wrong.  Staff at this location is not the best.","1099":"This Hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed at and I have stayed at many. Highly recommended. From the modern spacious rooms to the fantastic pool area and views. It has it all plus location.","1100":"I cannot express how underrated this restaurant is: great food, great price and great people!  I would love for more people to know and frequent this wonderful restaurant because they deserve it - but I'm selfish too.\n\nEverything is amazing there.  You will be coming for traditional Thai cuisine.  I highly recommend the Nam Tok, Squid Salad, any of the curries and the Drunken Noodles.\n\nEnjoy!","1101":"Natalia P. gave me a cut, condition, and partial foil today and it looks phenomenal. I never really know what I want done with my hair, just that I want it to look good, and she definitely understood my vague instructions and gave me a cut I'm comfortable with but looks fresh. \n\nThe salon's environment was lovely, and the front desk attendant and girl who washed my hair were great as well. I was offered a variety of drinks upon arriving (water, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, wine, and more) and salon also features a boutique which was fun to peruse before my appointment. I highly recommend this salon and look forward to returning soon!","1102":"The Tony Roma's remodel is great inside and out.\n\nI used to get depressed when we had to go to Tony Romas because it was dark (even at lunch) and the menu, pedestrian.  Now, we've talked about going back more frequently when we drop off our guests at the airport because of their recent renovation.\n\nThe exterior is more upscale and sleek with an outdoor patio.  The interior is much brighter than before, more welcoming, and it has an open kitchen.  The menu has local produce listed, and for the plating\/size and unique spin on the typical meal, the menu prices are very reasonable.","1103":"LOVE this place! It has a fantastic spin schedule. They are very welcoming and have people participating at all skill levels.","1104":"Fantastic spot. I ordered beef swarma (sp?) and instead of rice got all salad. Yum. Wife ordered combo rice. Fantastic choice too.","1105":"I give this five stars because it's \"As good as it gets\" for a death metal pizza place since I don't have anything else to compare it to.\n   Situated on 6th street admist the chaos of the young and drunk, we get a little gem of death metal and pizza.  The pizza is greasy, tasty and  fills you up after an evening of  debauchery.  I stopped in here to grab a slice before a night out and loved the atmosphere which included a  hardcore kid working the counter, Underworld on the 19\" tv and a soundtrack of Death Metal to comfort me as I ate my pizza.  It was a nice escape from the outside crowd.\n   If you like to step away from the ordinary and ease on over to the dark side then you'll love Hoek's.\n  \n   I only wish there were one in my hometown.","1106":"Oh, if I could love a restaurant more I think I'd be leaving my fianc\u0413\u00a9. \nI have been here twice and once to Uchi. Uchiko was a better experience both times. It is a truly magical experience and so refreshing. There are so many restaurants popping up all the time in Austin that are all style and zero substance and they could all take a note from Tyson Cole. I've never experienced service so excellent at a restaurant before. I strongly believe newbie restaurant owners should take field trips here to learn what's up. \nIt's the little things at Uchiko. You know the food is excellent and inspiring, that's a given, but it's really the service that makes them stand out for me. They go so out of their way to make you feel like a guest, not just a customer. Whether it's the bartenders throwing in a free app while you wait for your table or just the honest and knowledgeable recommendations from your waiter. \nEven though we pay easily $200+ when we come here, I never feel ripped off like I do at so many restaurants around town. It is an absolutely phenomenal experience that is honestly more akin to theatre than a typical restaurant experience. Uchiko is a truly special restaurant that deserves all the hype it gets.","1107":"Ya know, for a chain restaurant, the steak at Bugaboo Creek is pretty darn good. In fact, it's the one chain restaurant that I really find myself craving on occassion. The decor is kinda kitsch-y, but the food is actually quite good. Serve has been kinda hit or miss every time i've been there- we've had some really great service, and some really poor service. There are 2 reasons that Bugaboo Creek gets 4 stars instead of 5. First, they're a chain, and I don't think that there's any Five Star chain restaurants out there. Secondly, their corporate offices do not make their nutritional information available, which I think is completely ridiculous. Any place that is standardized enough to be a chain should be standardized enough to have their nutritional information figured out. But going on the quality of the food alone, Bugaboo Creek is worth a visit.","1108":"Dr. Hymowitz was great! The whole experience was easy and convenient. I had never worn contacts before but by the time I left I felt like a (almost) pro. They have a great selection of eyeglasses and though I resisted at first, the lady who helped me knew what she was doing!","1109":"Nice environment, good meal. This place has both indoor and outdoor seating. Standard seating gets busy, but we were able to walk right up for bar seating on a Friday evening. \n\nWe started off w\/ sushi & brews. Tempura shrimp sushi roll as well as a spicy tuna roll. Truthfully, this was my first sushi experience, but it was pleasant. The tuna had a nice spice to it, but not overly spicy. The restaurant had several beers on tap including several locals (Red Cypress, Crooked Can, Cigar City, etc).\n\nI ordered scampi shrimp and scallops for an entree. The scampi was good. It was not over\/under cooked at all. The dish was what you would expect from scampi. I ordered asparagus as a side, which was nicely cooked. The whole dish met expectations for scampi w\/ asparagus. Overall, the sushi was the best part of the experience.","1110":"Don't really get the hype. They call it handcrafted gelato on a stick, but it literally just taste like any other Popsicle for several times the price. I can't seem to appreciate this place, but maybe it's just me. I don't really have a sweet tooth to begin with. \n\nOne great thing is that the toppings can be customized, and the display fridge is pretty.","1111":"Late night comfort food dining. On a cold rainy night I came here with some friends and was not disappointed.  We were a party of 6 and did not have to wait long for a table.  The menu was huge - I didn't get a chance to try the Congee because I wanted to save room for other dishes.\n\nI can't remember exactly what the dishes are called - I should have taken a menu but I have pictures! \n\n- deep fried spicy tofu\n- clams in black bean sauce\n- fried pigs intestine\n- roast duck with plum sauce\n- thousand year old egg\n- stir fried pea shoots in garlic\n- spare ribs\n- deep fried little fish (bak fan yu - translated I think it means \"white rice fish\"?)\n- deep fried fish (cod?) with corn\n\nEverything I tried was yummy - my favorite was the deep fried tofu, it was delicately crunchy, spicy and they used fresh oil! The deep fried little fish were also  delicious, not too salty either. \n\nService was efficient and friendly, no complaints there.   I will go back and try the Noodles and Congee - I just need to get 3 more stomachs like Bessie the cow so I can try everything on the menu!","1112":"You do not need teeth - the brisket simply melts in your mouth!!  The smoker is right next to the restaurant - you will feel the heat and smell the love as you walk in!  Best Texas BBQ I have had in Austin so far. Last two visits (been there only twice) they ran out of beef ribs one order before my order-the second time they gave me the hint to call ahead so they can set aside and hold my beef rib order.  Third visit will be the charm! All the sides are awesome.  Staff and service are great.","1113":"the pretzel tasted maybe a bit stale. the cheese sauce was cold. (is that even legal?)\n\nno go.","1114":"Me and my boyfriend just left Gino's and had one of our worst dining experiences. The couple seated behind us were having a similar experience and at least provided us with some comic relief. It took about 15 min for our server to bring menus but when se did, she apologized. She took our order, didn't write anything down then came back and asked us what we ordered again. She brought 2 waters even though my boyfriend had asked for iced tea, about 15 minutes later brought our salads then came BACK and asked what we were waiting on so she could look out for it. Our 2 slices of pizza came another 15 minutes later like warm and not very flavorful. The couple behind us had to refill their own drinks and go searching for silver wear. After finishing our food and not being brought our check we went to the counter to pay, where the server had to wait for another woman to finish taking to-go orders and helping customers before she could get change for us. So much for grabbing a quick dinner. We were there for an hour.","1115":"It's a small cafe, wish it was a bit more spacious so you're not almost elbow to elbow to the next table, but regardless of that, I would still recommend this place to anyone!\n\nThis is the first time I have ever had braised short rib for breakfast (Fricasse).  It was deeeeelish!\nIt was served in a cast iron pan, consisting of caramelized onions, watercress, braised and shredded short rib, slice of applewood smoked cheddar (if you haven't had that before, try it at Whole Foods, that is one of the best cheeses everrrr), topped with an over easy egg.\n\nI had all that plus a waffle with their berry compote.\nI could have eaten 10 of those waffles!\n\nWill be going back soon!","1116":"Tasty and a decent value for the price.  Also open to 11pm during the week and serves Maine Root fountain drinks--lots of positives.","1117":"$85 for dinner for two, not including drinks and we both left hungry.  That's really the bottom line.  The food was good, but at these prices, I shouldn't be leaving hungry.\n\nFood is the cheapest cost at a restaurant so there's no excuse to be so stingy.  The $23 tortellini had 8 tortellinis.  They call it a 'light summer dish'.  It's not like they are identifying themselves as tapas either.  It seems they serve very little food so you aren't so full that you don't order dessert.  But I think after having 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes and having so little food actually served, we were ready to get out of there and have an actual meal.\n\nAlso, the caesar salad, while a decent salad, was not what one would call caesar.  The croutons were rock hard.  It came with one (pickled!) anchovy, and the dressing seemed more olive oil and lemon juice and nothing else.  A light salad, but certainly not caesar.\n\nFood quality is excellent.  The room is excellent.  Staff is excellent.  But I shouldn't have to go to Shake Shack after spending $85 on dinner.  Frankly, I felt like a sucker.","1118":"Another great \"hidden patio\".  A great place to kick back after a walk around the waterfront on a warm summer day.  This spot is a bit off the beaten path but has excellent beers on tap.","1119":"Free stuff! That's pretty much the long and the short of it. \n\nSampling Lab wants one simple thing from your. Your opinion! In exchange they will give you free products to enjoy (or not enjoy) and review. Said reviews are passed on to the makers of the products. Viola, it's that simple. What's not to love? I have gotten a sugar scrub, many products from FishPeople, candies, all types of little goodies that I wouldn't otherwise have tried. \n\nThere is literally no downside to this place. The space is beautiful. TOO beautiful to be giving out free things, what did we do to deserve this? If you were giving me free stuff out of a dark shack I would still take it happily. My understanding is that you can rent the space, which would be great for an intimate something or other, it has a very PNW vibe. Employees are friendly and helpful. \n\nThe Sampling Lab doesn't have a ton of stock as of late. It's hard to keep free stuff on the shelves I would imagine. It is literally next door to my gym so I can peek in if I see something that catches me eye. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if your in the area it's worth stopping by.","1120":"I can say I have only been once, but those before me inspired me to write a review.  I went to see a rockabilly band, whose name I can't recall, a billion years ago.  It was completely seedy and with sterile, hospital floors, and I had the best time.  If you take the pretension from a bar, you take the pretension from the people.  All that leaves is a medium for a good time. The beers were cheap, and I danced all night with people I didn't know and would never meet again.  \n\nAt least give it a one-shot deal.  You only live once; mark it off the list.","1121":"We had 11 in our group for a birthday dinner.  The setting was perfect, the service was prompt and accurate, and the food was delicious.  Four people had the grilled sea bass and raved about its freshness and salsa-like accompaniment.  Several of us had the lamb cassoulet that bursted with flavor and a balsamic sauce.  Bread pudding dessert was a hit as well as the classic chocolate lava cake.  The wine selection was plentiful and the whole evening was fun, intimate for a family birthday, and the ambiance friendly and warm.","1122":"For over a year now I have come to Border Grill and they are still the best taqueria in Orlando. \n\nDon't be afraid... Try the lengua (tongue) taco! :)","1123":"Damn girl I got so lucky coming in off the street! I had waited for two weeks for the Benefit Brow Bar at Macys to be able to accommodate me ( yes you read that right.. two week wait ) but I'm a sucker! My appointment was at 12:20 and I got there at 12:23 because my boss asked me to finish something up, and they flat out said they couldn't take me. Whatever. Screw that place! So I typed eyebrow into yelp and saw the good reviews for threading here, two blocks away.\nI came and made an appointment for after work. Got there, friendly attentive staff, then... I meet Roju. What a fantastically unique, funny, genuine person (my first instinct was to write artist... I know) - I had never been threaded before and I honestly will not do anything else again (she made me promise I would throw out my tweezermans). I looked in the mirror and loved them, but noticed some stray hairs in the beginning of one of my brows and asked about them. She said:\"no. I'm right. You need to let that part grow in.\" I laughed and said ok, and honestly when I got home later and took a long hard look - she was totally right. You gotta respect someone so good at their craft they're willing to defy the customer because it is for their dumb customers own good! I'm glad she did. Also - threading leaves your face feeling smooth like a baby's bottom. Just  sayin.","1124":"It was lunchtime on a Saturday when I stopped into Fiouna's and it was dead. The staff all looked terribly bored and borderline miserable. Not the most welcoming but I was craving falafel so we stayed.\n\nThe layout isn't like most other falafel\/kabob shops I've been to. You order from the menu at the register but you don't get to customize what goes on your sandwich\/wrap. I was kind of annoyed by this since what I was served, lacked all of the great condiments that I've come to love on my falafel. The falafel wrap was very tasty though I have to admit. It wasn't the flavor combo I had been craving but still tasty.\n\nThe price of my falafel wrap was much better compared to my husband's lamb plate. For $13.95 he got a heap of rice and 2 little chunks of lamb. Again, he said it was delicious but very overpriced for the portion.\n\nIf you're in a pinch, then give it a try but otherwise I'd consult Yelp for another spot to get your falafel fix.","1125":"I think their name gives away their review \"LONE STAR CAB\" DOESN'T DESERVE MORE THAN ONE STAR!\nI called at 1pm to be picked up, the cab didn't arrive until 3pm.  So why did I sit there like an idiot waiting to be picked up so I could go to work?????  Because when I called Lone Star Cab (about every 20 minutes) to check on my cab they said, every time I called \"my cab was on it's way\".  REALLY?  on your way to hell, I hope.  \n\nNow I've called the company to talk to a manager, yes, to complain about being extremely late to work today because I was waiting for an incompetent cab company to deliver, and the phone is answered by a child and\/or two people laughing and talking incomprehensibly.  \nI can't think of a good way to describe this business except for the general sucks-so-bad-you-might-as-well-walk.","1126":"Okiedokie, let's do a little education first.  When a restaurant is small and extremely popular and in a very popular part of town, you make a reservation, m'kay?  Being told you have to wait or there isn't a table when you walk up during dinner or brunch rush is not the restaurant's fault, it is yours.  We decided on a whim to come here, but called ahead and made a reservation for later that evening.  Yes, we had to wait 2 hours for that reservation, but because we called we were able to go shopping and do other things rather than sit and stare sourly at the host.\n\nAlso, I found the staff to be superbly pleasant and obviously dedicated to their work.  I watched the entire staff while there, as I had a view of the entire room, and it was like a dance.  They all help each other and watch out for each other and give a head's up or quick word to the table's waiter if it wasn't their table.  The manager walked the room three times while I was there and spoke to each guest at least once to ensure a pleasurable experience.  This was a level of service and cooperation rarely seen outside the five-star scene.\nIf you find attitude here, you brought it yourself, love.\n\nThe food is carefully crafted to bring out specific flavors and combinations that the chef has designed.  This is not Applebees.  This is carefully crafted food, and it may not all be to your taste.  But that is the theme and design of this restaurant.  Frankly, I f***ing love it.  No, not everything on the menu, but the concept.  I spoke with the staff throughout the meal, and they take care to buy local when possible and also sustainably raised\/harvest food when possible.  I like that in a restaurant, as that is how I eat at home.\n\nThe drinks were also crafted with as much care as the food.  And while pricey, it was worth every penny.  Don't come here on a budget, but it's not overly expensive either.  The value matches the pricing perfectly.","1127":"This place is one of my favorite places to go on a late night. If you haven't tried KFC (Korean fried chicken) you're missing out! This place is soooo good. I highly recommend the KFC combo! They use an entire chicken (~17 pieces) and you also get a pitcher of beer of your choice. They offer a couple of sauces (some to dip, some you can toss). Tip: you can ask them to toss half of it in one sauce and the other half plain or in another sauce! The chicken tossed in Korean sweet and spicy is my fav. They also give you a side dish of picked daikon radish. I wish they gave us more side dishes! It's free so I really can't complain. I've also tried their kimchi bulgogi fries and liked it! It's not the same as chilantro's but it's still very tasty. They have other dishes like the military pot which I've heard good things about. \n\nThe server is incredibly sweet. I always talk about him when I bring my friends to college roadhouse. I've been a couple of times already and always enjoy my experience here. They have karaoke rooms if you are interested in that. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, deff check it out! They will be open on sundays from Nov 18 and on! So yay come get your KFC fix.","1128":"Its been over a year since I visited Alfredo's, and I still rave about it.  Alfredo's is absolutely the best Italian food in Atlanta, period.  This place wrote the textbook on customer service.  My wife and I were seated at a four-top table.  While we were in the process of sitting down, two people descended on the table to break down and clear off the two extra place settings.  Our wine glasses were never empty ( I highly recommend the house Pinot Grigio).  The waiter asked me 'What type of pasta would you like?'.  I asked him 'What kind do you have?'.  His response?  'I said, what kind do you want?  We can make it...'\n\nThe food was equally as good as the service.  Don't let  the outside of the restaurant fool you.  Alfredo's is a first class establishment all the way around.\n\nTake your wife here for your next anniversary, and you won't be disappointed.","1129":"Board the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (PeopleMover) ride vehicles anytime; as there's rarely ever a wait to board, and at the speed your vehicle goes, no one ever get's sick on this ride.  Although it feels slower than what most books say is actually 7 miles per hour, the ride is a pleasant surprise.  And the fact that you're always covered is another pleasant surprise.\n\nOne thing I don't like is that at one point you're forced into a dark tunnel that shows  you the inside of the Space Mountain exhibit, which can make this ride seem creepy to young kids who don't understand that you're really not on the Space Mountain roller coaster ride at all.  Even when the Space Mountain ride undergoes maintenance, and those lights are turned on inside, this can really spook out some guests (including myself). Remove that segment Disney, and you'll be doing fine in my \"book\".","1130":"I've lived in ATX for over a decade and rarely have found SUCH impeccable service. We were blown away when we went for dinner and drinks last night. Beautiful scenery, great food and cocktails and, again, out of this world service. Cannot wait to go back when the weather cools off. Highly recommend for date nights, etc.","1131":"I have been there more than once and wonder why it isn't packed. Great food and nice folks. Check it out! Garlic knots are fabulous. The salads and pasta are very fresh. Good house chianti also. Help it stay open with the new train coming!","1132":"I booked a reservation for 5 for 8\/3\/2013 at 6:00PM.  I just got a call to confirm my plans for dinner with my wife and three kids.   The girl that called said that the patio was our only option as the Dining Room is for couples that are getting away for date nights and that you like to keep that area quiet.  \n\nI am puzzled...  Talk about first and last impressions...  She didn't even ask the ages of my kids?\n\nJust cancelled that reservation via Open Table and found another option for tonight.  Maybe Bobs Steak House downtown will let my family dine in the main dining area. \nDisappointed...","1133":"This is as close to dining in Italy as you'll find in New England.\nChef Paolo is bringing exquisite, authentic Genovese cuisine to the North Shore.\nIf you're looking for fine dining in a fun, casual atmosphere run, don't walk to Prides Osteria in Beverly.","1134":"How does the song go? \"When the moon hits the sky\/Like a big pizza pie\/ That's Amore...\"??? Well, it is love, love, love from me to Baraonda.\n\nMy new job is in Midtown, which is fabulous for my lunch options (not so much for my pocketbook) and I finally tried this fabuloso Italian place! One of my favorite dishes ever is Checca (helpful tip- it's pronounced with a hard \"ch\" sound like a \"k\") - a short pasta like penne, garlic, basil, fresh mozzarella and chunky pieces of tomato, with olive oil. Baraonda's is the best I've ever had. \n\nLoved sitting at the bar. Loved the friendly bartender. Loved that I wasn't familiar with their wines, so Eddie won me over when let me sample tastes of three reds so I'd know what to order on a future dinner visit. My pasta came out quickly, just timely enough that I only ate one piece of their yummy bread with olive oil and parmesan.\n\nSo many things look good on their menu, and I can't wait to go back and try the lamb sandwich with goat cheese and romaine (how yummy does that sound?!) and that the diner next to me was greedily enjoying! A new favorite place!!","1135":"I love Camp Bow Wow and my dogs love it even more.  I appreciate the customer service they give.  They always remember my dogs' names and are so sweet to them. Most of all I l love being able to watch my dogs play all day on their webcams from anywhere in the world!!!  I highly reccomend them and will continue to use their services.","1136":"This was one of the best meals we have ever eaten.  There was absolutely nothing that wasn't perfect.  I had the Angus beef filet, with B\u0413\u00a9arnaise sauce and iI wanted to lick my plate!  My husband had the lobster\/halibut\/scallop in an excellent ginger sauce, and it was to die for.  The appetizer was a salmon tartare and melon squares, which were a perfect combo.  The bread was hot, crusty and a lovely sourdough.  I don't normally eat dessert, but everything was so wonderful we couldn't resist - and both were worth every calorie!  My chief regret was the fact we had such a late lunch we weren't able to try the Five Course meal for two.   I can't imagine anything not being done to perfection, and we had to settle for only two entrees!  Oh, and the views of Vancouver harbor are spectacular..  A perfect evening and a perfect meal.  On my Vancouver must do's for our next trip!","1137":"Yoga Sakti is such an amazing place. The numerous classes they have to offer and the space itself, puts Yoga Sakti in my top position for yoga studios on the North Shore of MA.","1138":"A step above the TGI's and Ruby Tuesdays of the world. The whitewater shrimp is a great appetizer, and the deserts are a meal in themselves. The ambience is what I felt gave the place a special feel with a talking moose and antler shaped lighting fixtures. Its a nice place for families and large groups, not realy for a date","1139":"The portion sizes are HUGE.  You are sure to get more than you should eat.  The chicken burritos were very large and tasty, but I has expected them to be on a plate, not something you'd eat with two hands as opposed to a knife and fork.\n\nI did feel very greasy after having eaten there.  I thought it was odd that I couldn't just order a bag of chips & get a side portion of salsa.  The chips & salsa I ordered had the tomatoes on top of the chips which just made them soggy by the time I got home.\n\nSince they are located in Fern Park, they aren't really close to where I live, so the food had cooled off considerably by the time I got home with it.","1140":"I've recently started working in the area.  This place always looked busy.  One night my husband and I tried it out.  I ordered vermicelli with spring rolls and pork.  Decent but I've had better.  Portions were good, just needed more flavor. My husband had Pho he seemed to enjoy it.  Service was on the slow side, and it wasn't too busy.   Its a pretty big restaurant, modern, nice and clean.   I'd go back to try other menu items.","1141":"Just got my new car today and it was a very nice experience we've got from the staff of Nissan (new ownership Clay Clooney) especially from Elaine our Sales person. She was so sweet and professional, and was knowledgable with the product she's selling and gave us very good information about the car were buying \nIt was an awesome Customer Service, from the Sales manager Danny, and John who arranged all the paper works to enable us to take my car home.\nThese was our 1st purchased to Nissan and I will definitely reffer them to my friends. We are so satisfied for all the services that nissan offered us.\nThanks so much for all the staff, we had so much fun purchasing our car today. Well done and keep up the good work!","1142":"It's OK. Curry chicken sandwich was good, crab croissant wasn't that great. Decent brew selection and good mimosas. Food just isn't anything special, but I enjoyed the experience overall.","1143":"I've been going off again and on again to Pro X for almost a year now. I was originally going to the Boylston St location but switched to the High St location for convenience. Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.\n\nI work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. \n\nAside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. \n\nIn Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. \n\nAlthough I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. \n\nEric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. \n\nJess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized. He has an incredibly staff that demonstrates customer services at its finest.","1144":"Amazing sushi. Among the best in town. I've not been here before because Thai food isn't a personal favorite, knowing they have this quality of sushi, I will be back.","1145":"I have had ongoing neck\/shoulder pain that flares up when I spend a large amount of time at the computer. I visited Dr. Segal and after the first adjustment I felt 100% better within just two days. I followed up the adjustment with a visit to their massage therapist who did an excellent job and worked exactly the areas I needed. The staff at the reception is friendly and very willing to work with my insurance constraints. I will definitely be returning in the future.","1146":"The first time I found this place, it was an accident - I was walking up Hampshire to eat dinner nearby.  Now every time I'm in the neighborhood I stop by to check it out.  One of their many fascinating sections is their Local Interest\/Local History section, which typically includes numerous old books on the region.  Yesterday I found a 1903 book on the history of Vermont that was in excellent condition, very inexpensive, and had some pristinely printed & maintained historical & (at the time) contemporary maps of the area in it of a higher quality than many of today's maps.  I also personally especially like their cookbook section and, as a former library staff member, the way they have several sections that are interestingly categorized, like the one of creepy children's books. \n\nAs some other reviewers have already noted, the staff won't bother you when you first come in - which I too appreciate - but I have also found them to be very helpful when I DO have a question, which I also appreciate.","1147":"The smell of the meat being cooked was very good, so we turned in. It was a very busy evening for the restuarant. We were told the wait could be as long as 40 minutes, and when it was only 15 we were pleasantly surprised. The restuarant is incredibly loud. It is clean, and well lit. It has a nice view, with plenty of parking. The service was ok, though we had to remind our server to bring us 2 different items. My wife paid for filet mignon. What arrived at the table was not, or it was so poorly prepared it no longer tasted like, or resembled filet mignon. Not a good place for a romantic dinner. I don't know what they could do to lower the noise level. With a different cook staff it could be a nice place, but it is not that now. We will not come back. It is simply not worth the money or our time.","1148":"I love the high level of training for the most part.  Friendly staff, awsome coaches,  variety of classes, convenience, great training partners, etc... I love this gym!","1149":"Pretty darn good upscale fast food. The sauce bar is yummy and has about 10 dipping sauces. The cheese on the cheese fries is super good. think melted, good-cheddar, not nacho liquid. The place is pretty small thought, a lil claustrophobia inducing, hopefully they will expand with success and add more tables and waiting room.","1150":"Love this place! The chicken tenders, chili, meatloaf, and bacon wrapped dates are my 4 favorite things. Lots of flavor and I never leave hungry, and you get a good amount of food for the money. Also, their dipping sauces for the chicken tenders and meatloaf are delicious!","1151":"Like others have mentioned, there is a woman who follows you around to ask you to open a Kohl's charge card. My husband and I have a joint card there, and she tells us that we should open separate ones so we get more percentage off coupons. Why would we want more than one credit card? The percentages off that we do get are more than adequate since we don't actually live in the Kohl's store like this woman apparently does. As I'm sure most other people do, we end up lying and saying we each have our own separate cards just to get her off our backs. We have made a game out of seeing if we can avoid being asked by her while we're there, but it's gotten to the point that even doing that it's still so irritating. I've decided that even though this is the closest location to us, I won't be shopping here anymore.","1152":"Reminded me of Northern California. The seating is not the best but other than that\nthis is a great place. Very nice people. Great service. Very healthy and tasty food.\nI had the Roast Chicken and loved it. They have a cool fireplace as well.\nI will be back to try a couple of other things. They have brunch as well but call first...\nHave Fun.","1153":"My partner liked the food but it made me sick all night. Service was also odd- the server\/owner was on his phone the whole time.","1154":"Even if I didn't have a black clad, Cure worshiping past, or live a few blocks away from it, I'd still love this place. Even though it is a cemetery it puts pretty much every public park I've been to to shame in terms of diversity and beauty and attention to detail in the living elements of the park. The stone monuments, many of which are gorgeous and worth visiting to see on their own, just end up adding to the experience, especially if you are able to disassociate them from their morbid significance.\n\nIt's America's oldest arboretum\/cemetery\/elysium, based off of the Pre Lachaise in Paris, though I honestly think it is more beautiful, perhaps because if feels more naturey  and pretty than I remember the Pre Lachaise being.\n\n175 acres of rolling hills, ponds, wildlife ranging from frogs, herons, to woodchucks, a tower where you can get a near perfect view of Boston, 700 different species are represented in the cemeteries 5,500 trees, all of the paths have horticulturaly themed names...what isn't there to love? If you are history minded, you can go and seek out the graves of some of the cemetery's more famous \"inhabitants\" such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Gray, Winslow Homer, or Mary Baker Eddy. The cemetery also offers guides describing the different trees, birds, wildlife, and plants you can encounter during your explorations of the grounds.\n\nIn the summer, nothing is more peaceful or tranquil than grabbing a book, my camera, a bottle of water, maybe a friend, and sitting next to one of the ponds, feeling the sun on my skin and listening to the frogs serenade each other.\n\nI feel like Mt. Auburn truly is a superb testament to the intertwined nature of both life and death and how the two constructs can, and must, exist in harmony with each other.","1155":"Alright, growing up in a Korean American family, you'd think for special occasions, we'd go out to a Korean restaurant, right?  Well, that wasn't the case in our family.  We'd always go to Lee's Mandarin (Mt. Prospect, IL) for all HS graduations, birthdays and special occasions.  \n\nThat being said, I have always like Chinese food more so than Korean.  My brother Tony K. currently works at Lucky China so I thought I'd pay him and the restaurant a visit.  The restaurant is at the end of the strip mall and is cozy in size.  With the red\/black decor and dim lighting, this place is definitely a cute date spot.\n\nI had a craving for some Thai and noticed they had chicken pad thai on the menu.  Imagine that? A Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't the best, but I dug it.\n\nThey also serve sushi there and had a sushi chef on hand to make you rolls on the spot.  My favorite was the \"Rock & Roll\" sushi roll.  Pretty tasty for being served at a Chinese joint.\n\nCheck this place out if you're in the area.  It's pretty good food and the price is just right for the quality of food you get.\n\nIt's a great place for take-out as well. :)","1156":"Best restaurant in the Boston area -- not just in Concord -- by a long shot.","1157":"I've gotten smoothie bowls from here two days in a row. It's my new obsession! My favorite so far has been the Orlando Magic Berry Bowl. I added granola to it. It was the perfect light dinner. They also deliver through Uber Eats which is convenient. \n\nI look forward to trying one of their salads soon. \n\nGreat to have an organic, gluten and dairy free option in the area. So good!","1158":"For a place called Hong Kong, this place is pretty American.\nOtherwise, the stars are for the scorpion bowl-sweetness. Everything else is just dirty and grungy. =\/","1159":"You have heard don't judge a book by its cover and this is a perfect example. It's the most fabulous Italian restaurant in Columbus no doubt in my mind however, it's kind of tucked in this nondescript strip mall near Polaris. Artie and his wife Natasha are gracious hosts who really take time with their customers. It's old school. A beautiful bottle of wine hand picked, a homemade dinner and service beyond what you find unfortunately almost everywhere today. The homemade limoncello is so good that you could skip dessert and just have this aperitif. But my children love the chocolate bomb that Natasha makes. The one side of the restaurant is cozy tables and the newer side is for larger parties. If you have a nice big party of over 20, don't hesitate to call them. Or people in from out of town. It's impressive and they don't disappoint.","1160":"This Dunkin' Donuts is the most convenient for me on my way to work, which is the only positive thing about it. I try to stop quick, but even when I'm the only one in the driveway there is such a long wait.\n\nToday I ordered a water and a toasted English muffin with butter. I didn't know toasted meant burnt. I didn't have time to go back and get a new one.","1161":"I love iPic and Maxwell took great care of us. Love this place, come almost every time I'm in Austin. Great drinks, good food selection. Service in your seat with a powered seats, comfy pillow and blanket. What more could you ask for? Oh. A massaging chair. That would rock! Thanks iPic!","1162":"I have done business with Audio Systems since they moved into their store decades ago. They carry high quality gear from small systems that are not very expensive up to  high end. They are a real audio store.They have their own somewhat quirky style, as mentioned in another review, but I appreciate that they don't push me to buy particular products and do not upsell and use high pressure. I like a store that lets my ears and pocketbook make my decisions. Also, they don't try to pile expensive accessories onto every purchase. \n\nI have found them honest and reasonable and they have had my positive regard for a long time. \n\nNo one is perfect...recently, I had a problem with how something was handled. Mark, who runs the store, treated me respectfully, listened to my issue and we reached an agreement with which I am pleased.","1163":"I loved this place! The food was delicious. The service was great. The waitress was nice. I came for a visit from Boston, MA on vacation and when I suddenly spotted Papi's, I immediately had to give it a try. I was impressed with the restaurant d\u0413\u00a9cor, service, and food menu. I had the shredded chicken, yellow rice, plantains, black beans and salad the first time. Delicious. The second time, I stopped in before heading back to the airport and just got the appetizer sampler that came with stuffed fried potato, ham croquettes, and a beef empanada. Delicious. I was not disappointed both times I went. I came with two friends and we were all completely satisfied! I will come here again if I have the opportunity to.","1164":"Definitely give this place a chance if you've never been before! The breakfast tacos are always amazing, and I've tried them all! :D the Migas taco is probably one of the best I've ever had. If you go for lunch, the Thai chicken salad is super good, with plenty of chicken. The staff is always super friendly. They treat all their customers as if you've been going there for years!","1165":"The wait was very long so if you are hungry, go somewhere else. If you are hungry but not enough to keel over and go from hunger, then you are not going to regret waiting for this place.\n\nYou are seated at something like a ramen bar and you'll probably be sharing a table with someone you don't know, but it's likely that's how it's like in Japan. Our friends advised us that their tamago ramen is their best and it was so good because the broth was not too salty and the ramen was al dente. You might be tempted to get the one with more cha siu (pork), but since their noodles are their best part, you can also order just noodles when you're done your original serving. It's worth saving room in your very hungry self from waiting all that time.","1166":"Got to Boston on Thursday, I only really wanted to go to one place that was Wahlberger it was a 45 min drive from the house all I kept hearing was \"genny better like this burger\" we get to there Saturday everybody got a burger & everybody liked it! So glad that it was good! Wooooooooot woooooot! Was very busy in there but it didn't take long at all to get the food.","1167":"My favorite pizza in Boston.  Was there last night after having an urge for this pizza for a week.  It must be the sauce or the dough, but this pizza tastes so fresh and delicious.  You gotta be into the ambiance which is not fancy, to say the least.  It's a funky place, but the pizza and grilled meats are basic and exceptional.  Starting to want some more right now!","1168":"A great portland\/beaverton breakfast spot.  I come here a  couple times a month. They have great food and are friendly staff.  Quick and the food is hot.  Can't ask for much more.","1169":"I have come here several times during lunch with my coworkers.  It's pretty hidden away, since it is in a small shopping plaza behind a Chick-Fil-A and a Ruby Tuesday.  The place is clean, and it can be hit or miss as far as being busy during lunch.\n\nLunch is a great time to go as far as their lunch specials.  You can order 2 sushi rolls from a good selection for $8.95, and for 3 rolls I believe it's under $12.\n\nTheir service is something that this restaurant can do so much better.  There's typically only one server up front, and depending how busy it is - you could be waiting a while to get your food and check.\n\nOverall, not bad for a lunch spot.  However, when I'm out on date night with my hubby or having dinner with the girlfriends, this place will not be my top choice - as there are a few other places that top it by food quality, service, and location.","1170":"Went here for lunch today. Really good! Like the first reviewer the burger was a little on the too pink side but edible. We walked in for take out and it was ready in 8-10 minutes. Everything else was great. Will absolutely be going back!","1171":"I tried this place the other day because sushi garden was packed. Everything looked good. But I would say the food isnt that good. I probably wouldnt ever go here again for thai food.","1172":"I never like posting poor reviews, but I had expected a much better experience from the other reviews I've read.  It probably didn't help that this came at the tale end of a quiet weekend spent along the coast...  the place is very lively and I wasn't in the mood.\n\nBut the real reason for the 2-star review was a combination of stale bread and my blackened cod that tasted mostly of chili powder.  I like chili powder as an ingredient, but when it is the main flavor I don't care for it nearly as much.\n\nMy salad was fine and my wife's Fishwife Seafood Combo was tasty, so I know they aren't a complete loss.  I also suspect that if I'd gone for something more like Fish & Chips that I'd be more happy.\n\nWe'll see.  I don't know that I'm going to make that much of an effort to revisit since I live clear on the other side of town.","1173":"Hey! I ordered my food online for pickup. When I arrived they forgot my cheesy bites and, too, none were readily available. It would be 6 min. for another batch to be ready. I was offered a drink while I wait. Such a nice, simple gesture from a sweet staff. Thx!","1174":"I absolutely love the chicken then thuk. The noodles are sort of shapeless and chewy. The broth is rich and salty (in a good way), and somehow holds the heat so the soup stays hot until you're done eating. Delicious. I took off one star because the service is a little weird, though not terrible. There is one server who just makes a lot of non sequitur remarks every time he comes to the table which makes the customer feel a little crazy trying to understand the connections.","1175":"I finally made it to Tassili's this past April and was not disappointed. Truly lived up to my expectations. I'm still reminiscing about my \"dat ish\" wrap topped with the black love stew. The staff was so nice and helpful. I wish they delivered wraps to NYC. Next time I'll make sure to bring enough wraps back home. Wish we had a place like this in the city. Definitely will be back!!!","1176":"Ittoku is awesome. The staff was super nice upon arrival and attentive! TBH I have never had better waiting service in Boston. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that customer service is important to me haha.\n\nThe place was pretty busy for a Thursday night, but we were seated quickly. I didn't have anything to drink, but we ordered the beef and garlic dish as well as the yakisoba. Both were hot, delicious, and well seasoned! Although we only tried these two dishes, i'm sure the other menu items are just as great and authentic judging based on drooling over other customers' foods.\n\nI will definitely be back to try out their drinks and smaller plates on the menu (oh and the omusoba!). The location itself is pretty inconvenient, but the restaurant and experience were well worth the distance.","1177":"We stayed at a 2 bedroom condo from 6\/16\/13-6\/22\/13. Our reservation was for 6\/15\/13-6\/22\/13; however, we did not arrive until the morning of 6\/16\/13. I called to notify customer service so there were no issues. When we got to our condo, we were blown away! The entire condo was spotless, spacious and the second floor with loft was a pleasant surprise. This place really felt like home. I'm giving the resort 4 stars rather than 5 due to the cloudy pool. We took pictures with our waterproof camera and noticed that the water was cloudy. The pools at Disney's Blizzard Beach were way more clear. We will definitely return during future visits to Orlando.","1178":"Worst meal ever!!! An hour plus from ordering and I was served raw pasta. Pleeeese!\nThe room looks nice, but no chef should have let my meal past the line, nor allow it to take so long.","1179":"I don't dole out the 5 stars too often but damn, why haven't we gone here sooner?  Sassy servers, good prices and AMAZING food. Standard breakfast fare and not so many choices that you're overwhelmed but enough to give you variety.   Their pancakes are delicious and those cinnamon rolls?  HOLY BALLS!!!  They were like pillows of heaven with cream cheese frosting.  I even hate cream cheese frosting and I had to take 2 1\/2 bites.  I was psyched to see they carry mixed fruit jelly from my youth and my enthusiasm over this prompted the server to give me some to go.  We will definitely be back!","1180":"In an effort to reach out and be friendly, I treated a couple of people from work to lunch.\n\nA bento lunch box for $10 is a pretty good deal.   I could start comparing Apgujung's deficiencies to a handful of wonderful Korean-Japanese places in Ann Arbor, but you would probably just tell me to go back to from whence I came.  That is a lot of backtracking I do not want to do. \n\nI sort of learned a thing or two about myself and other people, as I continually do.  It never gets old, like deja vu.   People make a lot judgments.   Those who think they are the least judgmental are usually the most judgmental.  There are people in the world who seem to need to make negative judgments about others in order to feel better about themselves.  Don't worry if they think you are just the shallow and showoff type, just move on.  Don't try to analyze what happened or judge their shortcomings, just move on.  You could be so intelligent and thoughtful in a very intellectual person's eyes but totally superficial and stupid to another person.    Don't worry about any of that, you can't please the whole world.  Just be good to yourself.\n\nAll the sincere and good people in the world, where are you?  I bet you were not having lunch at Apgujung.","1181":"They're not bad, but they're not good either. For what you're paying, I find their selections to be bland and uninspired. I also find the service to be slow and careless. Most all-you-can-eat places are careful with your orders to minimize waste, but they weren't too good with accuracy. There are better places to go, though I find this is an easy choice due to proximity to SkyTrain and seating.","1182":"This is our \"cheat day\" place when we're craving for some good comfort food.  The workers seems to look happy to work there which reflected on the great service we received.  I love their meatloaf, and I know we will be back for some more.  Indeed this place will be around for a while; no worries there.","1183":"Got the gluten-free brownie and gluten-free chocolate chip cookies and they were amazing!! Honestly, better than any regular chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Will definitely be going back for more!","1184":"Everyone in Portland seems to fawn over this restaurant, but I've had three scrambles in a row now that were sub-par. Today my lemon ginger sausage scramble was tepid and somehow...watery. The accompanying potatoes o'brien were fair but nothing to write home about. \n\nI'll probably come back again because the service is great, drinks are fun, and, most of all, because all of my friends are hypnotized by whatever je ne sais quois the place exudes. But I think I'm giving up on the scrambles at Genie's altogether.","1185":"I go here all the time for their food, entertainment and the social fun atmosphere. Last night (Wednesday) I went for karaoke night and by far that was the most fun I've had there. Also I decided to go the healthier route and got the Walrus salad, it was sooooo good!!! One of my favorite spots in Columbus!","1186":"Absolutely I MEAN completely INCREDIBLE Peach Plum Pear crumble pie! Sourceam Blueberry or Raspberry pie Great too AND can't forget the BUTTER tarts mmm mmm delish! Staff is uber pleasant and happy even when its busy.  Thank you! \n\nUpdate!!! Ok so I was dreaming of peach pie today and all summer actually......just a few hours too late whoops they're sold out! After much himming and haaaing I had a Buckwheat chocolate chip walnut cookie... and then Dam.....Another one! So soft chewy delicious BUT i came for pie so I was not leaving without one and at $4.95 i cant resist considering the mediocre ones in kits are $7.95.  Ok so here is my pie\/dessert biking adventure in print.   Sour cherry pie from tartine Davie street and French Vanilla Gelato from Yaletown Gelato on Homer and Davie.  Tartine doesn't offer ice cream with their pie but Ill still give them a 5 for deliciousness and patience with me.","1187":"Great company to deal with. Very friendly personnel and very hard polite workers. Went smooth as silk from quote to finish. Replaced 150' of storm damaged fence. Very pleased with install and timeliness. Would definitely recommend to everyone. A++ work and job satisfaction. Thanks for the great looking fence :)","1188":"Great service. Clear communication and follow through. Hallelujah. My little car is running great. I just moved my business from another Toyota dealer\/service provider (12 years) to Broadway - it's closer and much better.","1189":"I am here for a conference, so I stayed in the same hotel. Consierge and receptionist were nice and answered questions kindly and promptly. Upon arrival to room: noisy room AC, dusty desk, very few toiletries for two guests. Room service: ordered salad which came with a sticker on the tomatoes. I called room service to let them know about it and first person  just \"apologized\", second person didn't even know why I was calling and offered to replace the salad, after I told the third person \"you should offer me a reimbursement for that salad\" then only she called the manager, and finally after 7 minutes between being on hold and getting too many \"I apologize\" followed by silence and \"are you there?\" she finally offered to remove the salad from the charge. Fitness center: you get charged to use it 15 dollars per stay, the fitness center is within the Spa which is on the first floor, to get there from the elevator you have to pass by a bar, a restaurant and gift stores, (imagine yourself on your gym outfit saying hello to colleagues attending the conference), which is very inconvenient as another fellow yelper mentioned. For me its too pricey for what you get, not worth it.","1190":"Update:  A few changes\n\n--they now offer Wunder-Pilz kombucha \n--the bowls are only made on weekends\n--they are offering fresh juices from Johnson's Backyard Garden (cold press for $2 more--same for juices)\n--they advertise as 100% vegan\n--no more 12 oz size.  $6.50 is now cheapest drink for 16 oz\n\nThis place is still just as amazing!","1191":"The Hot Chocolate is a run race and a Peachtree Road Race qualifier, so if you do well on the course, use your time when you run on July 4th to boost your seeded wave. I have done this race twice, so you really have no idea what to expect in terms of the weather. It might be cold or it might be freezing cold. Make sure you have compression pants for this race, you will thank me later. I cannot stress it enough, do not wear cotton clothing, as it does not wick away your sweat. You will be running 15K (9.3 miles) and as you run, you will be sweating and all that sweat will be absorbed by your clothing and wet and freezing cold weather will make you extremely sick... not a good combo. So wear polyester fibers... or better yet wearing cold gear... \n\nThis race is known for their goodie bags, hot chocolate, banana, melted chocolate, a bag of snacks and a very cool fleece jacket that you should not wear during the race.\n\nOverall, this is a fun race, something I would recommend at least once.\n\n[Review #491] (76th Review of 2017)","1192":"I wasn't aware there was two locations as the first location I went to on Stark street i wasn't impressed. Went to their second location in Pioneer Square and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it was good.","1193":"I was in the cardiology dept as a patient so I felt extra dutiful to try and eat healthy, and since I had a visitor coming, I thought why order hospital food for dinner?\n\nSo I had them pick me up the cobb salad and the baked fries.\n\nIt's not the best cobb salad I ever had but one of the best healthy cobb salads I ever had. I just wish I hadn't poured the dressing on. The dressing tasted very chemical. So I'm curious as to what was in the dress, because the rest of the veggies were crispy and fresh in the salad. I think I would have rather eaten without dressing than the one that was given. \n\nAnd those fries are good for you? I have to look into this more because I'm sorry they were delicious!! And I wasn't so medicated that I didn't know they were delicious. And fries are a red light food for me. I usually don't allow myself to have real fries because then the fry frenzy begins.\n\nBut these were flavorful and crispy. And they weren't piping hot by the time they made it to my hospital bed even. So, I would eat here again. Nice to have a healthier option that is quick and not to expensive.","1194":"This business is NOT great because I purchased a used bike for my daughter and it does not meet her current needs exactly and they are refusing any kind of return. I paid the price they asked but before I did I asked what a similar bike sells for new and he said over $200 which made $120 sound like a deal. Turns out the bike I bought is only $135 new. My bad for relying on a small shop to be honest. They refused to deal in any way to take this bike back claiming they just can't do that. I will not take any more business there as I am so disappointed in the honesty and integrity of the shop. I dealt with Brett so I recommend steering clear of the place if you're looking for an honest business","1195":"I'm a meat eater- think paleo, and I think this place is great! What meat eaters don't seem to get is we can eat vegan\/vegetarian food! And when it's good, it's very good! \n\nI first tried NF in a yurt in CA; I loved it then & I love it now. I avoid highly processed foods now, and my favorites there tend to be the fake meat items (highly processed) and the cupcakes (so good- but the frosting is highly processed) but I still like eating here every so often. They really do vegan right. It's really all about the sauces & seasonings. I'm ok in the kitchen, but I'd love to be able to make flavors like they do. I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, \"I coulda made that better at home.\" But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do! Kudos Native Foods for being dedicated to your cause AND truly delicious... Not just for vegans!","1196":"Had a great experience with this company today. My fiance and I had a small, local move to contend with, and they made it all painless, sending exactly what we needed: a guy and a truck. Cheerful, timely, professional, and so reasonable. Will definitely use again.","1197":"This sushi restaurant has a lot of potential. Our experience was not the best. The waitress was rude and not able to stand by our table long enough to answer basic menu questions. Food was good, barely above average. On Sunday they give a standard special 15% off the bill although they didn't advertise. The other coupon on Yelp is outdated and was for Valentine's Day. They need to remove it. This is a pet peeve!","1198":"My wife lost the key fob to her new car and was locked out\nWe found Integrity on the web and called them on Saturday \nI explained the situation and he ordered new fobs for us on Monday with overnight \nshipping. He then came to our house on Tuesday to rekey and program the fobs \nNir was very responsive and arrived right on time \nI would recommend them for any locksmith services","1199":"Yes, the food is fantastic. It really was and I highly recommend it to anyone. But this review is mainly for the customer service. I don't think I've ever met such a NICE and welcoming group of people in a restaurant. Truly, I will come back again for the nice smiles and service. Again, the food was great but these people are really wonderful and will make your day!","1200":"Nice friendly staff, food is great pretty busy there. Good varieties of breakfast, they even let me change of the side too","1201":"Fantastic food! Fast and friendly service too! Happy hour has a great nachos bar that is complimentary and the fajitas are fantastic! I lived in Texas for almost 10 years and was ecstatic to see a Chuys open at Easton. It definitely lives up to its reputation and is worth the wait! Margaritas are the best in town too!","1202":"Had a horn problem they inspected it for free and gave a free overall inspection listing out what needed to be done for the car. Love the service these guys gave me. Im so happy that I found a honest auto repair shop since im new in town. Appreciated good service from these awesome team. Free shuttle is a big bonus!","1203":"Very cute dessert place. Huge portions. Macarons, but not so tasty compared to La Duree or the ones made by J'Adore Macarons.  Asian style desserts.","1204":"Part of Loews Hotel on Stuart\/Berkeley corner. Love the atmosphere, amazing $1 oyster special (4-6 pm) and good menu. My biggest beef is the poor beer selection...they should replace the large brewer options with craft choices (the craft choices they had were sold out).  Overall, this isn't a destination location for us but we will visit again when we stay at Loews next.","1205":"Very impressed...food is made from scratch onsite. Great staff...great atmosphere...great food.","1206":"Been here for Dropkick Murphys every year and a Flogging Molly show. Definitely an improvement over Avalon.","1207":"Mango slush with the cubes on top is so bomb. It's a must get if you come across one of these cafes. It's a chain. I want to try the bubble waffles next time I visit Canada.","1208":"WOW. Only word I can use to describe our experience yesterday through this morning.\n\nWe got one of the huge suites as it was a special occasion and everything about its appointment, the staff service, all of it was first rate.\n\nWho doesn't need a TV that comes on in the bathroom mirror and has reflected screens in the shower? I mean, c'mon.\n\nThe palatial suite was about 1400 square feet so beyond luxurious for a couple and with those kind of doors that lock on both sides that connect to other rooms, it would be ideal for a group\/family gathering. My fiance had requested an assortment of pink roses in vases, and spread all over the suite, and it was amazing and gorgeous and so special. We don't drink so our \"welcome treat' was those special size Diet Cokes in tin cans and chocolate covered strawberries. \n\nValet parking was complimentary with this level room, and as we were on the Club Level, there was a lovely room with tons of seating, small tables, arm chairs, and such with meals\/drinks\/snacks through the day at almost all hours. The breakfast might be called \"continental\" but it was only a hair \"less than\" the spread downstairs. The fluffiest eggs (my absolute fave are well done hotel spread eggs), a ton of perfect fruit, Irish oatmeal, a coffee machine that makes every drink you could want, breakfast burritos....I could keep going since I love breakfast food so much!\n\nThe hotel was BUZZING with the football folks, another big event going on in a large ballroom, I'm sure what was just early holiday traffic, and everyone we encountered was pleasant, helpful and just lovely.\n\nI loved everything about my fiance's idea that yesterday should be a \"trial run\" of sorts for our wedding NEXT December 1 and the InterContinental was a super place to choose for the royal treatment.","1209":"I miss Le's; I used to come here A LOT back in my college days. The food is delicious, down-to-earth and inexpensive. You can get a lot of food for your money. Best of all, service is fast, but if you do want to sit there for a good an hour or two longer, they dont do anything to shoo you out. This is a great place to go with friends and family-- a very practical eatery. Lets just say if a guy takes me here on a first date, I probably won't be impressed.","1210":"I booked a 3:45 appointment for my friend's wedding nearby. I arrived at 3:30pm and asked if there was any way I could get my blowout early. Instead, I was (rather rudely) told that I was much more likely to get started 10-15 minutes late. No consideration at all for my timing. Then at 3:50 I was told I was up next. I let them know that I had to be out by 4:30 at the latest and they told me that would work. Finally at 4:07 I told them I didn't have any more time to wait and left. No apology, I just got an eye roll. Hopefully that allowed someone else to be a little closer to on time. Worst service and disappointment ever. Good thing I was able to borrow a curling iron from a friend otherwise it would've been a bigger disaster.","1211":"Exquisite food, great cocktails and beer. I go to Columbus for business and a friend recommended this place. I had a pork tenderloin to die for. Perfectly prepared, oven roasted vegetables and reasonably priced. They even knew how to make a Last Word.\n\nThe service was responsive and attentive. It was so good that I took my client there the next day for lunch. Perfect burger and salad.\n\nFast forward two months and I returned with my wife. Unlike me, she is a Pescetarian, no meats only fish and veggies, and I suggested Wolf Ridge. The tenderloin was gone, they revise menus regularly, and she had a vegun risotto grain dish. Superb. Grains were slightly el dente. I had the Tomahawk chop and we shared a forest floor salad (wild greens, mushrooms, walnuts, blue cheese and a wonderful vinaigrette). \n\nA little of the beaten track but worth it. \n\nThe only downside is the acoustics. The place gets loud so out is not a place for a quiet intimate dinner but better than pounding club music.","1212":"Let me first say I HATE teppanyaki restaurants with the flipping knifes (although there wasn't any sushi bombing antics going on that we saw.) But we like sushi so we ate at the 8-seat sushi bar. Ordered the chef's special roll, \"made with the freshest ingredients\" which they said included lump crab and avocado. Except it was actually krab, which by no definition is \"fresh.\" It was late so the place had slowed down quite a bit from the early evening rush. So you'd think the wait staff had a little time to actually wait on you. Nope. Had to go find chop sticks. Had to wave down passing personnel to get drink refills. \nSecond restaurant we've eaten at during our 8-day stay here and again ... the wait staff. Maybe it was just our one wait person, who seemed angry to even be there. Because some of the others seemed cheery and capable from afar. \nI know you're saying 'It's a hotel restaurant in a tourist trap town, what do you expect?' I expect not to be misled by the menu. And I expect that a person working for tips understands that tipping is not automatic and if you make we work harder to get my food than you get serving it then I'm prorating that on the tip.","1213":"Don't live here. Don't do. It's not worth it. Seriously, you would be better off finding a rando roommate of craigslist than you would living here. \n\nI lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. It's luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didn't clean to the point where his room should've been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. \n\nThe main issue is if these people aren't your roommates, it means they're your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies they're too immature to actually take care of. There's constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they're required to be on a leash. I'm amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. \n\nThere's constantly garbage everywhere - there's was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. There's a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but it's like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. \n\nBecause the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. \n\nThey advertise \"gigabyte internet\" in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. \n\nA significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and aren't completely incompetent don't seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you. My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone - they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about. \n\nAll in all, this place in absolutely awful and you should not live here at all ever.","1214":"This B&N is a good size, with a well-laid out - eh, layout.  When you walk in, the magazines are to the left and the caf\u0413\u00a9 is straight ahead.  To the immediate right is the checkout counter and the rest of the store is everything else. \n\nThe sections are clearly marked and sorted by general topic or type of book. They have everything from fiction, fantasy, romance, biography, classics, etc.  They have a cool selection of books on local things like Oregon trails, pet friendly travel in Oregon, and much more. \n\nWhat's cool is they have a whole section on American History (AHEM, to the guy who said there are 0 books on WW1), and history in general including many books on WW1. \n\nAnother feature of this B&N is that there is a HUGE kiddies section at the end of the store. Here, kids will be able to find just about any book they are looking for. \n\nThe caf\u0413\u00a9 section is large, and many people use the sitting area to sip something tasty while reading enthralling and entertaining stories. They have free WiFI (in addition to the WiFi offered by the Lloyd Center Mall), and you just have to accept the terms of use and voila, you're online.  \n\nI would go back to this B&N, as it offers a nice place to take a break from a long day of shopping.","1215":"Great fast and friendly service. Just needed a trim and that's exactly what I got! Ask for Cristina and you won't be disappointed!","1216":"I love kimchi but only for lunch.  Their prices during the weekend are insane.  I Took my family there for lunch and couldn't believe how much more expensive it was.\n\nI'll just only go during the weekday","1217":"My dad loves this place and insists on eating here every time he comes into town. The choices and combination are endless making this ideal for picky eaters and vegans. The food is moderately priced, the service is excellent even when the place is busy. They even have a full bar.\n\nIf you've never had Mongolian BBQ before, give Golden Tent a shot.","1218":"The $5 Wednesday night pho special (7pm to 9pm, ignore their website's promise of 6pm) is obviously the main draw for me. I usually get the #17 or #20, depending on whether I want just steak or some brisket also. 5 minutes after ordering an immense tureen of tasty pho is deposited in front of me and I go to town. 15 minutes after that I'm a beached whale, a stranded walrus, a dog who got into a full bag of kibble. It's great stuff, and while I can't claim it's the best I've ever had in my whole entire life, it's certainly worthy of being considered for all their awards they brag about.\n\nI'm always disappointed when Vietnamese places don't do banh mi, and so despite the vast menu, much of which is quite good, I'll hold a grudge. But that pho is definitely worth coming for, maybe even worth paying full price for if it happens to be the 95% of the week that isn't 2 hours on a Wednesday night. Their lunch specials are also worth a look. They're either $7.25 or $7.50 and include scads of shrimp\/beef\/pork\/chicken dishes with white\/fried rice, soup, and an egg roll. Definitely worth a place in your Asian rotation for lunch.","1219":"We finally get some hot summer weather and I decide to pay to go into a 95 degree room to excercise. This is a great yoga studio. No attitude and I was made to feel very welcome the minute I walked in by the person at the desk and the owner, Roman, who also instructed the 90 minute hot yoga class. The place was spread out, very clean, and had a nice atmosphere. They also have a parking lot. I will definitely add this place to my fitness circuit. I left there with my zen back in place.\n\nI've started taking Daniel's class at 6 pm on Fridays and it is an awesome way to start the weekend. While my colleagues are still at the office for happy hour drinking beer and eating junk food, I'm having an even happier hour. After sitting at a computer all week and accumulating stress, this class hits a mental and physical reset button for me so I can really enjoy the weekend. I also love that he plays music.","1220":"I really don't know what the hype is all about here. Sure, the ramen is a reasonable price. But it's not all that good. The noodles seem to be out of a package, and while the chicken broth is thick, it's not especially flavorful. The veggie broth is really, really thin and tasteless. The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.\n\nI also took half of mine to go (I have a tiny stomach), and the broth\/meat\/noodle mixture turned into this thoroughly solid gelatinous chunk overnight. It was so icky that I just threw it out.\n\nThe add-ins are really basic, the tables aren't especially clean, and you're under a lot of pressure to eat quickly and get out. Also - a big pet peeve is that it's cash only, but it's not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I didn't ask when I sat down, partly because there's one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it's posted somewhere!\n\nI really think that Boston could use a top notch ramen place that really takes the time to make their noodles right (or at least source them better). In the meantime, I'll stick with Totto.\n\nfwiw - I am spoiled by Momi Ramen in Miami and various ramen places in NY.","1221":"Came here for a quick bite. We had an assortment of sashimi and one specialty roll. \n\nIt was quick and efficient and the fish was fresh. There was nothing really negative about this restaurant to receive only 3 stars however the sushi was not the best I've tasted. \n\nDefinitely a quick lunch spot rather than a dinner date kind of place.","1222":"I hate it when people rate places based on their experiences with a competitor or like business.  I believe you should rate a business on its own merits...well I am about to break my own rule and say Pho Van is OK, even good, but compared to all the great Vietnamese places in Austin it pales in comparison.  The service I read below to be \"functional\".  I think that hits the nail on the head.  There are so many Vietnamese places where the Asian graciousness out shines the food.  Pho Van is adequate and I would encourage you to form your own opinion if you happen to be in the neighborhood.  The pork dishes are above average and worth a try,","1223":"Can't beat Marriott CRM. Checking in @ 10am. Handed over my ID, and after a quick glance at it they say \"oh yes, we have your room waiting for you.\"  Made me feel like I'm a regular guest here.","1224":"I just started seeing Dr. Brian and Dr. Chris within the past few weeks. I had severe back pain and did not know where to turn. Luckily my brother-in-law referred me to Ability. \n\nThey did a full examination to pinpoint the injuries I have been suffering from, a very informative consultation including charts and visuals that made it extremely easy for me to understand. They went over payment plans after looking into my insurance program to assure me I would receive the best possible care with an affordable payment plan.\n\nI honestly have never seen any other doctor that made me feel so cared about, they really do have your best interest in mind and really go out of their way to make sure you know that.\n\nI have a feeling I will keep going here for life!","1225":"I been to Chen's Noodle House several times for lunch.  Their noodles are handmade.  Gives it a lot character since the noodles are cut by hand so they have a not so straight look to them.  I don't know if it's just me or what but these homemade noodles taste so good. Plus the texture is different in a good way too. Not sure if it's a mental thing cause I know it's handmade or not.   The broth for their soups have a real clean and subtle favor to them.  \n\nThe place is really small so go early if you want a table. They have about 8 small tables there I believe.","1226":"LOVE this place! They are always giving out free samples of pizzas and desserts, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful too.  There are always coupons available, so it's a great deal.  Another plus?  They often have specials on desserts and cheese bread - we purchased them for $1 each close to closing time!  Basically, you can build your own pizza here; choose from a menu or choose your own toppings.  They do have gluten free crust options as well as thin crust, original, pan, stuffed, etc.  The pizza is deliciously fresh and you simply pop it in the oven and bake! Perfecto!  It is WAY better in quality then any of the other take out pizza places in town. This location is extremely generous with the toppings, so go crazy! I also like that they have \"gourmet\" toppings like artichoke hearts and kalamata olives.  They also have ready made salads that are great lunch options.  Everything's been delicious and they always hand out discounts and coupons to keep us coming back. Love it.","1227":"The food was fantastic, the setting is beautiful, and our waitress Meghan F. was so helpful and friendly. We took all of her recommendations, and she wasn't wrong.  \n\nDefinitely try the doughboys for dessert. They were my favorite part of the meal. \n\nWe will be back for sure!","1228":"Was in the mood for a bar burger so stopped in with my boyfriend who had been here once before.  There was some sort of football game on every tv.  The wait staff was very nice and very attentive to our table.  We each ordered a burger which was large and very tasty however it could have been seasoned a bit.  We also both received a side of tater tots.  They were falling apart which made them hard to dip in ketchup.  Should have cooked just a little longer to put a crisp on them and help keep them together.  Would not mind going back again but will ask for tots to cook longer.","1229":"I'm not normally into the health kick but was looking for something light and filling so decided to try this place.  As you can tell from my star rating, I was pleasantly surprised.  I went with the spicy korean bowl and was everything it promised . . . light bright healthy ingredients with good flavor and portions.  But the thing I cant wait to go back for is the beauty brew!! \nYou do pay a little more but it seems worth it","1230":"I've had the single burger here many, many times. This burger reminds me of a back yard cookout burger, but BETTER! Real thick juicy beef, not a floppy frozen cookie cutter mystery meat patty, cooked over real wood flame! Not many places where you can get that! I am very particular about my burgers & this one is PERFECT! \nGreen leaf lettuce, not cheap shredded iceberg, CHECK!\nRed onion, pickles, tomatoes, CHECK!\nToasted bun, CHECK!\nAfore mentioned real thick juicy beef, CHECK!\nCooked perfectly, CHECK!\nOver afore mentioned real wood flame, BONUS!\nZesty dressing, BONUS!\n\nI'm giving 5 stars, even though it is a food truck & so you gotta deal with the flies & the birds & the picnic tables that are never clean. Hopefully some day they can open a brick & mortar location.\n\nDO NOT leave your food unattended! I walked away for a moment to get a knife & when I came back, the birds had almost made off with my top bun!","1231":"I've seen shuttles from all the off airport rentals at least twice now (Sixth 3x) and still no Ace.\n\nWhen I called their number, went through a tedious menu, and when I finally got to \"speak someone at the Orlando office\"  I was then promptly told \"goodbye\" and hung up on. \n\nNot a cool way to start this business transaction.","1232":"Really cute spot to sit and hang out with people or quietly work on stuff. The music is soft and not distracting, which I love. There are four small tables and a big table for people to share, plus a cute corner with comfy chairs. \n\nI got a lavender latte, and I LOVE it. Perfectly steamed milk, fun latte art, and though I can't really taste the espresso through the lavender I'm sure it's also great.","1233":"Good but not great this time. Usually we are extremely happy. This time it lacked a litttle in service.","1234":"Update 8\/29\/2014: The recent strike ordeal revealed that Market Basket is an exceptionally good organization.  When the TV movie is made telling the story of Arthur T., I want to have a cameo as a customer.  :)\n\nUpdate 12\/21\/2013: Market Basket does not earn 100% marks because their new plastic carry bags are tissue paper thin although they look the same as the old ones.  When single-bagged, these new shopping bags are so thin, a soft styrofoam meat package can rub through it.  They cannot withstand pressure or rubbing.\n\nMarket Basket has no web site, no receipt survey, and does not actively seek customer feedback.  If Yancy-F-127 haphazardly crushes your eggs and makes a messy soup in the bottom of your shopping bag each time, while Aurelia-G-186 treats your eggs as carefully as if they are her own, the managers are not aware of who are their best, and who are their worst, cashiers.  The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. \n\nOriginal:\n\nThis is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a \"everyday-low-price\" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.\n\nFor people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.\n\nShoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.","1235":"I just bought my first new car ever today at MINI of Portland.  I went into the dealership with a \"say no to everything\" attitude to protect myself, and made sure Jay, the salesman who ended up taking care of us, knew I wasn't going to be swindled.  He was a very good sport and over the course of the hours-long transaction, we grew to like and appreciate his candor and his no-pressure approach.  He was extremely cool and just sat back and let the car sell itself.  I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone interested in buying straight to Jay at MINI of Portland.  (Also, the dealership is pretty snazzy, and has a giant espresso drink-making robot that is most likely the reason my heart is racing even faster than it should be considering how much money I just spent.)","1236":"Good quality food... The staff were very friendly and helpful. You have to get the mango lemonade.","1237":"DELICIOUS!  Amazing salad bar, wonderful meat.  Come here with a good appetite!  Too bad they don't have one in SoCal.","1238":"Very comfortable, friendly waitresses\/waiters and it mixes 2 great things: Food quality and price. I have been coming to this restaurant for 3 months and I always find seats. The food is excellent! This is definitely my favorite Vietnamese Restaurant in Boston.","1239":"Amazing dinner for our first night in Boston. They were so accommodating to our gluten and dairy sensitivities! \n\nWe had the oysters to start - delicious! Then for our mains we had the scallops, market fish and broccoli side. I would highly recommend this place if you have food sensitivities - they even have \"gf\" labels on the menu!\n\nUpdate: We didn't wake up sick from the food! A good sign that this restaurant really knows what they're doing with food sensitivities \/ allergies!","1240":"The only rental company that hires college grads. They have an incredible training program. Every employee I have ever encountered is polite, upbeat, and most of all knowledgeable.","1241":"If you live on the South Side this is a good mall for Macy's as it's never crowded and you can park a few spaces from the door, otherwise the mall is dead.\n\nThey also have a GREAT (black) Santa and a DMV office that is super fast.","1242":"I know the place is called Meat & Bread but their salad stole the show. The salad served on the day I visited consisted of chickpeas, fennel, red onion, red cabbage and oranges... no filler mixed greens or butter lettuce. Sounds a little odd but it was so good and filling - even my boyfriend enjoyed it! \n\nThe Porchetta Sandwich is also super good! The bread is crunchy on the outside and pillow soft on the inside. The Porchetta itself is cooked to perfection with crispy pork skin and juicy loin meat. I had a similar sandwich in San Francisco which is compatible but Meat & Bread's is slightly better in my opinion. \n\nGood place to get your meat and bread fix for sure.","1243":"This is a very functional cart curiously located away from foot traffic.  It sits as part of a houses garage entry.  The food is simple:\n\n-- Chicken or Tofu\n-- Teriyaki or Curry sauce\n-- Any extra (sweet chili, hot sauce, etc)\n\n$5 got me more than enough food (skewer and rice).   Very simple and excellent if you're on the go.","1244":"This store has the best selection of fabrics and yarn out of any place I've ever seen! There's usually a coupon for whatever you're looking for as well. Might have to wait a minute at the register, but overall a lovely store.\n6-2-2017 I had come into the store to pick up yarn and use my 50% off of one item coupon on my phone. Unfortunately I didn't have enough reception to load it on this day in line. I had tried several times with no success. My cashier Monica (I believe her name was) saw that I was having trouble loading that specific coupon and was able to find the code for it and gave me the 50% off. I found that so helpful and nice, it's one major thing that keeps me coming back is the friendly and helpful staff!","1245":"What a great place. Cool vibe, great bartenders, customer focused owner. I will definitely be coming back for more!!!","1246":"Before I start, let me say this:\n\n\"Give Chill A Chance.\"\n\nI know, I know, Vancouver. It's touristy, I'm touristy and altogether we're this sloppy, touristy sandwich posing around Gastown. I am sorry for that and I understand your disdain: I live in LA and we get that touristy crapola all the time.\n\nBut,but...hear me out. Chill Winston wasn't that bad, in fact I didn't think it was touristy at all. Shout out goes to the cute Hostess rocking a shaved head and the curvy girl indulging cheap fashion spots around Vancouver; you made an LA girl feel at home.\n\nLook, the poutine was crazy good, all gooey and savory with a hint of Jack Daniels. The beer list, heavy with microbrews, were fantastic and Winston's Earl Grey Creme Brulee'? Say whattttt? My dining companions had the blueberry coffee cake which disappeared after a 5 minute trek to the bathroom. \n\nStop that, Winston. Delivering good food on a warm summer day. \n\nShame on you. \n\nLook, I know it may seem pretentious, but that vibe wasn't there at all. Our servers were on the ball, a mix of white apron crisp and urban cool, and no one caused any dramatic, touristy scenes. So, locals...give this place a chance...it's honestly a pretty cool spot to nosh.","1247":"I had takeout the food was disgusting!!! I got the Egusi Stew smelled bad I added the Fish  which was very dry I was told it was whiting and it wasn't .The price for very disappointing to spend $14.00 on lunch that went right to trash.","1248":"Outstanding. Lived up to all the hype.","1249":"It's a local brewery with damn good tasting beer. What more could you ask for??","1250":"Love Jimmy John's. LOVE! however today at this location, it seemed like they were all about the FAST and not about the Quality. I understand the no sprouts thing anymore and I'm okay with that. However, forgetting the KEY ingredient in  a sub and then sending me on my way really stinks. I watched them make it and should have said something but really I thought I was wrong. How could they have forgotten? Won't stop going to Jimmy John's, just glad that I live in between this store and another one:)","1251":"I had the flat iron steak, very good and cooked too perfection.  Wife had the chicken with mashed potatoes.  Chicken was well seasoned and moist, potatoes paired very well.  I'm a big fan of the potatoes, would likely pair with anything.  Price point was as expected for food of this quality, especially on grounds of Disney.  Service was very good as well.","1252":"I've been going here consistently now for a few years. It is conveniently located for me and they have good prices on cigarettes. The people who work there are generally nice and helpful. The reason it only gets three stars is because a lot of times when I go there they are out of the very popular brand that I buy. Used to buy rolling tobacco there too, but stopped because they were out of it more often than they had it. I don't want to special order and wait for something - just want to be able to go get it. Not sure why they don't keep enough stock on hand so that they don't regularly sell out of popular items. . . . . I like supporting a local business though.","1253":"Cafe Belo is awesome! I've always had the same thing when I come here - Rodizio. \n\nIf you like a Brazilian BBQ, you've likely been to Midwest Grille or Olivera's down the street. To me, prices are a major differentiator for Cafe Belo. Servers are generally friendly and attentive enough, live music on Friday nights is pretty cool. Like anywhere, they have their nights. I've come a couple times when the meats were a mixed bag; some dry, some over or undercooked, but most of the time I've had juicy, tender cuts of beef, pork and chicken. I always leave full.\n\nI'm a big fan. Its a great value and you can really get as fat as you want, come hungry. Try the chicken wrapped in bacon!","1254":"First, working with this company is fantastic.  I hope they can keep the personal attention as they grow.  Don treated me like I was his only customer.  He was anxious to help me get what I needed on the day I needed it.  The website is easy to use to determine your needs and to place your order.  The boxes are great, very sturdy, it would be hard to break one.  The larger boxes could probably hold so much if you are not careful you'll never pick it up.   But I digress, it's rather inexpensive especially considering the fact there is delivery & pickup and you feel like all your items are in private storage locker when they are packed in the Bungoboxes.   I love it, and highly recommend it.  Just realize, you can probably only stack 5 or 6 filled boxes on a dolly.  So if you want items to remain boxed and on a dolly, you'll want multiple dollies.\n\n\nGreat company, great concept.","1255":"I have been going to Smita for the last 3 years. I have been here for threading and waxing.Never a bad experience. If you have a time constraint, it is good to let them know as there can be a wait sometimes even though you have made a reservation.","1256":"So like others have mentioned this place is hit or miss. What you can count on to be good is the ham and gruyere cheese croissant and the scone. An inconsistency is the plain croissant is dry, crumbly, and not good. Danishes also had dry pastry despite good filling. My latte was done right. I have not extended beyond breakfast here. \n\nThe ambiance of the shop is nice. Butcher block tables and modern decor. The pastries are self served on open selves with tong and bags near the register. I am not sure about this... it kinda grosses me out. \n\nIt will do in pinch I guess. I only went back because of Scout Mob.","1257":"Always come here for my curry fix. Today had something different and as usual aswdome","1258":"Thierry is kind of overwhelming when you come in the first time. The chocolates, the pastries, the ice cream, the drinks - it's a lot. But it also all looks delicious. THe bf and I shared a napoleon, a ginger ganache chocolate, a tea ganache chocolate, and iced teas. Everything was wonderful. I wish there was a place like this in SM - cute cafe to just get dessert. I'll be back.","1259":"After staying away for about two years, I was pleasantly surprised on a recent return trip that at least some of the things that made this restaurant a favorite when it first opened had returned.  A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the \"Singers and Standards\" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven\/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  \n\nSo I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.  Welcome back, Terra Terroir.","1260":"This hostel has a dorm feel. The bathrooms were reasonably clean, but one morning, I went to another floor because the bathroom on my floor was...not clean. My private room with a great view was just perfectly clean - I stayed for 2 nights. Breakfast is included in the price.  You can meet people from all over the world. There are also some permanent residents, here, too. The very best thing about this place is the friendly staff - I was there in the summertime - (they don't have AC), and the staff was wonderful in providing a fan or two for a minimum deposit. You get fresh towels, too. The location is fabulous - you're close to the T. Oh...don't have dinner here. Really - there are many options in the area. This is great if you're on a budget and visiting Boston.","1261":"Been going here for a while. One of the best thai restaurant in greater boston. From pad thai to ginger chicken rice to fish, all have been great. But their tom yum soup can be a little too spicy..","1262":"This place is uppity hipster heaven. Go at your own eye-rolling risk. Everything in this place screams \"I try too hard at life\". I have given every location more than a fair amount of tries before I ultimately wrote it off as being too bourgeoisie (never has a word been more fitting) for the lights of someone like me. God forbid I don't walk in there with my moleskin notebook alongside my oak+fort jeans and blundstone boots. \nFrom the ridiculous amount they charge for any drinks to the rude holier-than-thou attitude every location and its staff emanates, there is little to like about this instagrammer's paradise. \nI told myself that the second I found a butter croissant to rival that of Paris, I'd never go back and I tell you I'm all the better for it. 1) A better butter croissant does in fact exist here in Van and 2) I will survive without the \"uggh\" that follows any request I make from Matchstick staff.","1263":"In my opinion this might be the best burger joint in Portland. Now its not necessarily a burger place, but miniature burger place. But the variety is amazing! So instead of filling up on burger, you can have a couple different kinds and have a multi orgasmic mouth experience! Now don't get me wrong, you can also order any normal size burger here too... but then it's like any other place. Nah, go for the sliders!\n\nWhen my wife and I visited the other day we ordered The Hawthorn each, she got a Chicken one and I got a Philly. Now the hawthorn was great, weird combo of goat cheese and preserves. Mouth orgasm! Yum. Her chicken one was tastey, but not a good pairing with the hawthorns sweatness. Same with the philly. It was good, but not well paired. Next time we will either get sweet and sweet or savory only. We also shared the fries. I'm really picky about fries. I like them crispy, not soggy. I like them shoe string size and i like them hot. So these fries hit all of my req, they were perfect. Plus they were seasoned with garlic.\n\nI am a wheelchair user, and getting into this place is easy, flat and tables are large enough to accommodate me. Also the tables are tall enough to park under. The staff were knowledgeable about the products and pleasant to speak to.\n\nThis place does have beer on tap but I didn't try any. I will next time!","1264":"My buddy was visiting a friend that lives in the condo complex across the street from this place. I hoped into this cafe as I was running low on coffee. I actually ended up buying a cinnamon bun and a hot tea. The bun was delicious, and gave me an extra boost of energy. The tea was smooth and delicious.\nThe staff was nice. They gave me a good recommendation on what tea flavor to get. The cafe was clean, and their wifi connection was reliable. I'd recommend this place to anyone finding themselves in the vicinity.","1265":"Mario's is pretty great.  They are definitely worth the price, since they only charge $30-$40 for a woman's cut.  I have been there about five times, and got good cuts all but one time.  That one time wasn't terrible, but the woman who cut my hair gave me short bangs which looked kinda dumb.  Twice I had my hair cut by Mario, who gives a great haircut (along with his barber-style sparse conversation). \n\nOne thing to note -- from my experience, their cuts are better than their styling.  So I've walked out of there looking okay, only to find that when I style my own hair the cut actually looks great!","1266":"One of the best views of Portland! \n\nAdmission into the Mansion is $10 a person, but you can still visit the grounds and see the magnificent view! Parking is free, and it's a very quick drive from downtown to the top of the hill.\n\nIf you're short on time or cash, you can skip the tour of the mansion. For the most part it's just furnished rooms from the residents that previously lived there. You can get through it in probably 20 minutes or so.","1267":"Excellent service, great atmosphere, and delicious food. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive and the food was very tasty. They have a great selection of seafood, pasta, and chicken, and the appetizers are too good to pass up. It's a great date restaurant or restaurant for a small group.","1268":"I've eaten here a few times and the food and coffee is always good It's the service I am not thrilled about. The guys up front are either in a great mood or a horrible mood and, if you get them on a bad day, good luck! I was so offended by how snappy one of the cashiers were that I ended up leaving and going somewhere else that morning. Customers should be able to ask questions about menu options but they sometimes get a little rude. However, I have been back since and the food was still good.","1269":"We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. \n\nSome of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.\n\nThe ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue \"New England fishing scheme\" decor.\n\nBut we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks\/conversation\/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....\n\nI love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.\n\nThe bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)\n\nI love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more \"lobster pot pie\" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.\n\nAs for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. \n\nWith the bisque being \"good,\" the salmon chowder being \"meh,\" the newberg being \"downright awful,\" and the roll being \"meh,\" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there\/return\/be romantic\/eat more\/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere. (Psssst -- just go to Le Pigeon. Right now.)","1270":"Jeff Chow is a righteous dude serving some delicious Chinese inspired comfort food. \n\nNoodles that are chewy crispy and a garlicky spicy broth with Bok Choy. hand formed dumplings and wontons that are on point and chicken wings that are some of the best crispy delights in town.  \n\nYou can only go wrong if you don't make it in time before the Asian express runs out of steam or #yummies for the day!\n\nJeff is not only a friend, but a great cook. \n\nWe look forward to seeing what other amazing dishes he will turn out given a little more space to stretch those culinary muscles.","1271":"I've been to European wax center before and I've always loved it. This was my first time coming to this location and I will never go back. The woman at the front desk would not stop pushing me to buy a package. I understand you need to up-sell but it wasn't my first time there, she knew that, yet she continued to go through each and every package and explain them. I just wanted to pay and there was another client behind me waiting to pay as well but she would not stop talking. \n\nI received a full Brazilian wax. When i went home i discovered that not only are there a few very noticeable missed patches of hair, but there was a lot of left over wax that was not properly removed. A lot.... I had to go in the shower and essentially re-wax myself. Most painful thing ever. \n\nNeedless to say I'm pretty upset and will be taking my business elsewhere.","1272":"Worst car wash I have ever experienced.  Interior was dirtier than when I brought it in.  They did a good job vacuuming.  That was the only positive.  After exterior and interior was done, the exit takes you through the line of cars entering the autowash, where some guy with a water blaster hose does a quick spray before car enters.....excellent place for him to be......basically sprayed my car on my side as I exited, so now half my car is covered in water spots.\n\nCrappy crappy crappy place.  Maybe I should try a second time, and be more specific about what I expect in terms of \"clean.\"  Oh yeah - I shouldn't have to do that when they are in the business of CLEANING cars.  \n\nIf you want something done right, you have to do it yourself I guess.  Looks like I'm washing my own car from now on......","1273":"This taco stand has been a staple of my diet for over 2 years.  Cheap, fast, friendly, savory.  Se habla espanol, and they understand spanglish pretty well too if you need help ordering.  \n\nThe tacos are really delicious, asada, pollo, al pastor...you can't lose.  However, the real score is in the tortas.  If you want a bad ass sandwich, get to El Primo as fast as you can.  The bread they use for the tortas is the best bread I have ever eaten.  If Subway had bread half this good they would be running the New World Order by now. \n\nSouth Austin diamond in the rough.","1274":"The server was friendly but it took forever for the food to show up, and when it did, it seemed to be cool the fries were cold.","1275":"At first, I really liked WBOS...but after having it on in my office for a week was more than I could stand. They have staple songs that they seem to have to play at least once during *every* work day, and they were always accompanied with the same commentary from the DJs. By the end of the one week, I could called it all word-for-word.\n\nCan't comment on the non-office-hours stuff, but I doubt I'll ever turn in for it.","1276":"If you need a Neurosurgeon you want them to be better than good! This entire group of surgeons are amazing and I genuinely trust them with ease. \n\nWhen my Neurosurgeon of 23 years retired I panicked! Since my son was dating the daughter of a General Surgeon in Round Rock I decided to make a call and see if he could make a recommendation. An educated \"insider\" view was much more comforting than choosing from the preferred provider list my insurance company provided. I got online and learned all I could and agreed this was the practice that was right for me. \n\nMy first visit with Dr Fox was several years ago and this past June I was forced to have surgery since my foot and calf were going numb with zero improvements with steroid pills or injections. And, I'm happy to say I couldn't be more pleased! Dr Fox and his dynamite nurse are ROCKSTARS!! I just love them! \n\nIf you're forced to trust someone with your life and neurological health this practice is the place to be! I'd give them 10 stars if I could!!","1277":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner after seeing good reviews from our neighbours on the Next Door app. We were both really happy with our meals. We shared mahi mahi tiritas as a starter - very much like ceviche and very good.  For entrees, my husband had the chicken breast and I had trout - both very good. We sat in a booth by the window with a nice view of the wooded area around peachtree creek. Nice setting and great service. We will be back.","1278":"I stayed here for a wedding I was in. My husband and I arrived at 3pm on the dot and there were no rooms ready. Kind of bummed since we had a ton of stuff to carry up, so we waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes. The room was nice enough, had a lot of desk type space and since we were sharing the room with another couple, that was nice. It had a fridge, that froze everything we put in it, and a speaker dock, that didn't work. There is a keurig to make coffee. No fan in the bathroom, which is not awesome when four people need to take showers and get ready. The bride was on the executive floor which was where we got ready and they have a little snack area set up with a cool coffee maker and pop\/juice free for the taking. The housekeeping staff was great. We had the do not disturb on our door and when the one lady saw me going, she stopped and asked if we needed anything for the room. She definitely went out of her way. The paper is also hanging on the door each morning, it was the Columbus Dispatch. Valet parking for $17\/night and you just text them when you need your car. It was ready every time I needed it.","1279":"Love this new restaurant in our neighborhood. Great food, friendly service and when the weathers nice their outdoor seating doubles the restaurants size. They bake their own bread and offer wine and beer.","1280":"I loved this spot. I always like trying new foods and new spots so Merengue's was definitely the place! I came in and was sat down immediately. I ordered the fried beef with Spanish rice and sweet plantains. It came out really quickly. No more than a 10 min wait! The beef was a lil too fried but not bad at all! Great prices and good food.","1281":"Cute place ..slow service but really good food with friendly staff!","1282":"Skip the cluster parking lot of the Home Depot on Ponce and come here instead.  They have just about everything you could need, prices are good, everyone who works here is super friendly and helpful, and (for me) it is within walking distance!  Can't beat it.","1283":"Great place to hang out, they have a small amount of outside seating when the weather is nice. The sandwiches that I have had have been great. The smoothies are very good. Free wireless internet. Only problem is that it is sometimes very crowded.","1284":"Mark and his team prepared an awesome feast for my 50th birthday - kalua pork, teriyaki chicken, maui coleslaw, and sunimono salad - everything was DELICIOUS!! Their family recipes are fantastic (try their lava sauce!) and they could not have been nicer to work with - super generous and friendly :) If you're looking for a great anytime dinner at their food truck, or a feast for a special occasion, I highly recommend The Big Kahuna. FIVE STARS -- Mahalo!","1285":"Journeyman, I really wanted to like you. I tried so hard, considering the restaurant is literally 6 minutes from my house and thus my neighbor. I love Union Square and the refinement that Journeyman (purportedly) brings is definitely overdue. However... It just does not work. On paper, the restaurant is everything I love: local, modern, inventive, casual, but in reality, the restaurant seems to take itself too seriously. Despite the disappointing dining experience, I'm glad I went, I just won't be returning. \n\nThe hubs and I went to celebrate a wedding anniversary and opted for the five-course omnivore menu, added a serving of the foie gras, confit veal tongue and smoked beef heart. The five-course menu consisted of spring salad with favas, peas, spinach, carrots and had  \"spring foam\", that didn't seem to really serve a purpose; asparagus with soy and bonito; sous vide black cod with leek puree and potato; veal breast with sweetbreads and artichoke and a dessert of cane sugars, including macarons, shoofly pie and about twelve different things. As an amuse, we were offered a warm lentil salad, gruyere gougeres and house-cured ham. There was also a pre-dessert which was a flan with freshly grated nutmeg and post-dessert of poppyseed crackers with rhubarb jam and Florentines with house-made marshmallows. So all in all, we ended up having eleven different things to taste. If I were to order anything again, I'd ask for the cod and the sweetbreads, followed by the flan. Unfortunately, the rest just seemed discordant; the flavors weren't in harmony for me at all. Especially the asparagus dish was so bland, which was so surprising considering there were about 15 components on the plate! Each plate was pretty but the gels, foams and pearls can only get you so far when the flavors aren't up to \npar. \n\nThe drinks were wonderful, albeit tiny. For a $14 cocktail, I'd like more than 4oz. \n\nThe atmosphere was awkward to say the least. We did arrive on the early side, with a six o'clock reservation, but we immediately felt like intruders. There is no music, which automatically made us feel like we should whisper to each other. Space is so spare that some music would definitely compliment the industrial, even slightly clinical vibe. I just wanted the restaurant to feel fun and it is about much as fun as a hospital recovery room. \n\nThe service was... adorable. In the way that there is so much good-willed effort and so little actual success. I seriously thought that our server might explode with awkwardness. The stilted service made me giggly, which in turn seemed to worsen the awkwardness. Ah well. \nAll in all, our tab came to $270, which is kind of absurd, despite the fact that we had quite a few drinks - for half that, we could have had a much more substantial and meal at e.g. Island Creek Oyster bar, or Coppa. Not to mention we could have had a laugh.","1286":"Really great vegan bakery. So happy to have stumbled upon this place. Very responsible and delicious. They were also very kind to me and my son which helps! Can't wait to go back to try more!","1287":"Really wasn't planning on doing this but it wasn't bad. Number one complaint was the engine noise was so loud it was hard to hear the tour guides. Staff was friendly.","1288":"I don't know of a better deal in Austin for price, quality and taste. Had the BYOB with salmon, yellow dragon sauce and brown rice - delicious! And the spicy salmon roll (4 pieces for under $3) was a great appetizer!  We'll be going back regularly.","1289":"Came here with co-workers for our team-building lunch-on. The place has a feel of going to a Chipotle, FreeBird and Poke houses. However, more of a Mediterranean flavor\/Indian.  Albeit, its not authentic flavors to being Mediterranean\/Indian - basically Americanized.. However, it was delicious and fresh in its own way. I would recommend trying it at least once, and I do see myself coming back with my wife!","1290":"I went to the Coolidge Corner location last Saturday morning for my first Brazilian wax. I read online what to do to prepare and did such. When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean. I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer (I forget her name) I think Kelsey. Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping. I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax. She abruptly stopped, explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions. After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced! I said can you give me a minute before the next one? She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients. After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful. She said I've been doing this for over 10years, my response was I'm sure you have but this is not for me. She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING! She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room. I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left. Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional. She was blonde. She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on. She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled. Inside the exam room the floor was filthy, I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean. Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn't for me but I'd refer a friend here, hell no. It was dirty, the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank! Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left!","1291":"Yes indeed .... Put the car in drive and head to Somerville.  So we were out driving around the North Shore and Stumbled upon Posto.  I was intrigued it had so many reviews and wanted to see what the excitement was all about. Warm ambience abounds. A most gracious staff were eager to offer assistance. \n\nThe menu is a bit limiting but the options they offer are all delectable. I chose the gnocchi with short ribs in a red wine sauce. Oh yeah.... Mouth watering. My husband had the bolognese and although he prefers a wider noodle the combination of beef, veal and pork were a perfect blend. \n\nNow I would have rated this a five star but they charge for bread. My thought is if you serve meals with tangy sauces that should be savored by a swirl around the plate with some bread don't charge for it. \nJust a point that I thought should be notated. \n\nAll in all don't hesitate a jaunt to Davis Square.","1292":"This is our go-to sushi spot in Atlanta. The ingredients are fresh and they have a variety of roll options! The price is also very reasonable. \n\nKnocking off one star because the hibachi and bento box items are pretty bad. I would recommend sticking with sushi.","1293":"Really awesome burgers, friendly staff, homeade condiments, thats all I need for a good lunch!","1294":"Make a reservation, get a ton of friends, sit in the main room on Saturday, order the 3L boot and have the best night of your life. Nuff said.","1295":"This is a new place in town that everyone is raving about! I was dying to try it and I was not disappointed. I went for lunch with some co-workers (so no booze), but the taco salad was fabulous. We all enjoyed our meals. It was quiet for lunch time and the service was great. I also want to note that the decor is GORGEOUS. They legit revamped EVERYTHING which is good because the space needed it. Oh and the chips and 3 dips they give you when you arrive are very good!","1296":"Their menu is pretty big and has a variety of options. Any fast food greasy option you can think of, they have. Their slices are pretty big and their service is real quick. Great late night option if you're in the downtown area.","1297":"I can't really say much about FF since we weren't in the store very long, but I'm giving in 4 stars simply because of its vegan offerings.  While I've been trapped lately in this internal battle of whole organic foods vs. manufactured vegan goods.  As with all things, there SHOULD be a balance, but you know, balance is hard sometimes when you really just want to eat a grilled \"cheese\" everyday.  \n\nWhile I've been struggling with vegan junk food, I'm glad there's a place like FF where you can find vegan gummies, jello and marshmallows.","1298":"I love love their cakes!! I get one for every occasion. We are getting our one year anniversary cake tomorrow. Already planning my next cake for my birthday!! Highly recommended. Staff is always great!!","1299":"Horrible! We went on a Saturday night and the bar was loud and busy. Our party of 4 each ordered an entree, the food was bland and my chicken mac and cheese was so tough and dry that I had problems cutting it. The waitress clearly did not know the menu and forgot that my entree and my sons came with a salad, which I never got. The food is nothing to rave about, most of it seemed precooked. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food, we spent almost $60 on a horrible meal and I hope I can help others avoid doing the same.","1300":"Found Full Throttle after a not-so-great experience at a local VW dealership. These guys only service VW and Audi vehicles and they know what they are doing. The un-named VW dealership quoted me nearly $1400 to replace the timing belt (and other stuff u have to change with it). Full Throttle charged me $760 and did a great job. They are knowledgable and friendly to deal with AND... you can actually talk to the mechanic who is performing the service. Nowhere else gives you that opportunity. Will only bring my Jetta TDI here for service.","1301":"Great wings. Slow service.\nThis particular location is notorious for having slow service, especially when ordering drinks from the bar. Sometime I'll wait 15 minutes for a beer.\nThat being said... everything else about this place is great. Super friendly staff, excellent food compared to other locations, and the TVs are always on the right channel when sports are on. Don't let the slow service stop you from coming here. It's still a great place. Plus it's a bit larger than the surrounding locations.","1302":"Took my car here after not having it cleaned for a very long time. They gave it a thorough cleaning and wax and restored it to something beautiful. The price was very reasonable, and the man who worked on my car was friendly and had a very positive attitude. This will be my go-to car wash from now on.","1303":"I know, I know ... what could possibly be said about a butcher shop that might pique your interest to the point that you would kill half a day and find transportation to travel south to where the river and the inlet meet in Steveston Village? \n\nLet me first apologize in advance for offending any vegetarians or those of you that are trying to reduce your carbon footprint and then give it a try:  fresh, delicious cuts of meat, organic choices at prices unbeknownst to those of us in Vancouver proper, knowledgeable servers and butchers that know the details of cuts and the origin of the meats, specialty items that originate in France or the UK and are then carefully and lovingly raised locally and often organically. If you consider yourslef an omnivore (or a carnivore!?!) then Heringers is worth a drive south. \n\nThey also make deli items on site and they offer a meatloaf that is unequaled. Meatloaf! There is an excellent selection of mustards and other condiments that are happy accompaniments for your selections of prime cuts and there are cheeses, smoked meats, various dips and dressings and treats to choose from. \n\nThe favorites at my house include Berkshire Pork Chops and the Filet Mignon when nothing else will do. Heringer's is a great place to do your shopping in preparation for a dinner party and a nice break from the regular shopping routine. In price comparisons, I haven't found anyone locally that can compete with the quality for the same price.","1304":"Fantastic service and honest folks.  That's why I'm sticking with Dave's.  Why settle for less than the ultimate experience?","1305":"One of our favorite Salem restaurants nice atmosphere great deck dining and service\nFun all year round","1306":"I LOVED Pop Century. Maybe because I'm still a kid at heart, but this place is COOL! \nYea the rooms are a little small, but for the price it definitely cannot be beat. \nDisney staff is so friendly and smiley and polite. They help you with any questions you have. The resort has THREE pools in funky shapes. Open pingpong table next to the pool. Tons of sunning chairs. Larger than life statues of classic favs from each decade; I stayed in one of the '60s buildings right next to the Hippy Dippy pool. The arcade inside the main building was jam packed, filled with  addictive games. And they give tickets that you can trade in for prizes. Free shuttle buses to ALL Disney parks + Downtown Disney makes life so much more convenient. and we got Magical Express for staying at a Disney resort aka a big bus picked us up from the airport, dropped us off at Pop, and our luggage was automatically delivered to our room for freeeeee.\n\nFood court has simple selections: burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. Overpriced, but not obscenely overpriced. The best part are the three stations for drink refills: basically unlimited soda, coffee, slurpees, hot chocolate if you have a Disney cup. \n\nThe notgreat part was the keycard demagnetization. It happened so often and it sucks. We would walk all the way back to our rooms to be denied access. Then have to walk back to the main building to get it remagnetized. At least the staff was quick and apologetic. Made us feel a little less annoyed of the situation.\nand I also kind of felt trapped inside Disney's world. Made it a challenge to get OUT of the Disney area without a car. We learned to catch Lynx buses at the ticket&transportation center.\n\nOverall, I super recommend Pop Century. Especially if you're on a budget or have kids. All the perks of a Disney resort at half the price. I'd definitely stay there the next time I visit Orlando.","1307":"I was in the area and decided to check this place out. \n\nFirst, there are no real indicators on International to find this place....the address number isn't easily found nor the name of the business...it's about 500 feet back from the road.\n\nThe Yelp hours say they open at 12 noon.  Nope. 2pm. So I just wasted my time to come here. \n\nFail.","1308":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The spicy seafood pasta is to die for! The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. Highly recommend.","1309":"This place is a hidden gem of NW 23rd. The food is top notch (not even comparable to bar food). You can enjoy the best happy hour in town- try one of the pizza's and the mango salad! We also enjoy sampling their well-equipped bar (they had my favorite- Ransom Gin!). And of course their are the many billiard tables. This place basically provides a whole night of fun! I have also heard their tasting menu is a fresh and amazing treat. We look forward to trying that sometime.","1310":"OMG!!! Amazing menu, beautifully executed.  My husband graciously drove me there from Lake Buena  Vista.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed a wonderful meal.  I had an onion tart that reminded me of one I had many years ago in a Paris bistro called La Cour.  It was heaven on a plate.  I can't wait to go back.  The wine selection was outstanding.  The waiters were friendly.  Did I forget to mention the caramel popcorn?  Loved it.  I can't wait to go back.","1311":"Worst hotel experience of my life.\n\nIn order to get the \"Advance Purchase Rate\" they make a big point of saying they will take the full amount of your stay when you make the reservation.  Except they didn't, they took it 3 weeks later which meant I had to monitor my account.  \n\nWhen I checked in they charged me a second time for the full amount.  I had to speak with 3 people before I got anyone who knew what they were doing.  The attitude of the staff was annoyance that I was bothering them.  They did not offer to cover any overdraft costs that I might incur due to their mistake but only agreed to do so after I spoke to them about it.\n\nBecause of their incompetence and lack of customer service I'll never stay here again and I'll tell all my friends to avoid the place too.","1312":"Came here for a lil pre-bowling dinner. Located conveniently in Central Square, take the Pearl St. exit, and voila you're in a lil piece of Tibetan heaven. \n\nWe ended up getting a bunch of different plates and sharing it Asian family style. See Kenny for the list of what we had. \n\nThe food was so delicious. They also use 0% Tran Fat Oil.  \nI think the best dish was the pork fried rice, which is not your typical Chinese pork fried rice. no no no. This pork fried rice has eggs, broccoli, pieces of pork, spices, and onions. \n\nIn addition, the price is right. We had enough food to feed 5 of us and we only spent $17 each WITH tip. \n\nHere's a tip: GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! You won't regret it!","1313":"This place is right across the street from my office, and I hadn't really noticed it until I saw the Groupon offer - glad I did!\n\nTopline: Incredible food, pleasant atmosphere, a bit pricey.\n\nWent in a group of six, which was genius because we got to try a variety of items.  The bread and hummus\/dip that comes out to start off is very good and tasty... but don't overdo it because the food gets better as you go on.\n\nFor apps we had the bruschetta which came with chunks of chicken and was good (but I'm not huge on bruschetta so can't comment farther).  The calamari was fanstastic - well cooked, in a slightly spicy red sauce and the portion size was large and came with two big crostinis too.  I love that it was NOT fried like it is everywhere else you go.  We also go the eggplant\/spinach\/ricotta app and I'm pretty sure we licked that bowl clean - even the people who did not like veggies were in love with it.  I would consider it as an entree with a side of pasta in the future.\n\nI had the whole wheat linguine with squash, peas, tomatoes, mozzarella and some other veggies.  Good, light sauce and healthy but flavorful feel overall.\n\nOne friend had the gemelli with shrimp and scallops which actually sounded like the best thing on the menu but was slightly disappointing to me. The sauce was a brandy-gorgonzola, which was GOOD and quite unique but a little watery for the dish.  I would have liked them to thicken it up a bit.\n\nTwo friends got the chef's special risotto for the night and everyone was SUPER impressed with it.  Good portion size, perfect al dente, incredible flavor and lots of beautiful ingredients.  Excellent choices.\n\nAnother friend got the penne with chicken, sundried tomatoes, olives, and I forget what else.  This sounded plain on the menu but was actually quite good. I think it was my favorite thing on the table!\n\nOverall our dining experience was great and we all really liked the food.  Only thing is that the bill could be high if going back without coupns - especially for Watertown.","1314":"I have been to Atlanta before but on this trip I was able to eat at the blossom tree. It was worth the little walk from my hotel, the food was fresh and tasty and it was just perfectly served. \n\nYou can pick from Rice dishes, BIbibam and tacos. The best part of this place is that they have two sides that come with every dish. I opted for salad and dumplings it was the best choice, you can also\nPick from kimchi, rice, etc. \n\nI got Bibibam with chicken, brown rice, Korean salad and dumplings. \n\nThe restaurant is in front of a park and I got there early so I didn't have to wait long for my food. \nLoved this place and would definitely go back.","1315":"It says on yelp that the food truck opens at 12pm.  We arrived at 12:10 and the guys tells us it will be another 20 minutes.  \n\n\nSo we left and went to Zenbu sushi 0.4 miles away.   The funky tuna roll was da bomb.  I highly recommend it.","1316":"We have only tried the Bee Cave location... and we only go on Wednesday night and normally with a group of friends... That's Steak Night!!! The Steak Trailer pulls up around 6 or so and sets up. They take your order (cash only, separate from the cashier inside) for a great tasting and well-prepared rib eye with a huge baked potato and a salad (if you want). Inside, the place is ok... It's a good size bar and the food is mainly bar food. Our favorite is fried pickles... they're real good and go nicely with one of many choices of beer they offer. There are some other good bar food choices, i.e., chicken wings, etc... Not the healthiest meal but what the heck, life is too short... The service is ok but their servers are spread a little thin and if the place gets crowded the service starts to lag a little. But not too bad. It could get a little loud during sports events... but it's not a big deal. Overall, a decent casual setting if you're in the mood for a cheap but good steak (only Wednesdays), with bar food and beer...","1317":"Tom is very knowledgable in his field and is one of the most honest people in the business. I don't have enough hands to count all the times he has got me in and out with a quick fix. \n \nMy family auto shop has a small fleet of rentals and Tom has been our go to guy for as long as I remember. No job to big or small for him. \n\nI've used him on personal cars for myself, my girlfriend and even my girlfriends family. A lot of times he will get the vehicle back in a few short hours. He's even done work on some of our hot-rods. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone. An honest, knowledgable and over all great guy.","1318":"My wife and I have been searching for apartments over the last two months, and have dealt with many leasing agents in the apartment front offices. At one point several months ago we gave up on the IMT property due to what we felt was a lack of effort. We recently revisited the IMT to give it another shot because we did love the property and we happen to get helped by Gary Stiil. From the moment he greeted us it was like night and day from any other leasing agent we had dealt with over the last three months. It was very close to closing time and in fact I suspect during the tour of the property it was past time for him to go home. He never once referred to the time and we never got the impression he was trying to hurry it along. I even mentioned it being near closing time and he shrugged it off\n\nWhen we were done we explained to him we were determined to get a first floor two bedroom apartment with a yard and would be willing to wait for that to come available. I have had this similar conversation with other leasing agents and never heard back from them even after being assured  they will contact us when one came up. Gary took our information and made the same promise. Much to my surprise two weeks later I get an email from Gary informing us that he had found the two bedroom apartment with a yard. \n\nGary is a real standout and complete professional. He made the tour enjoyable and fun and followed up on his promise. I will also add that after the tour that day my wife and I were hanging out near the property talking when we saw Gary leaving. As he walked by we talk for a moment before he went on,  and that's when I realized he was waiting for us to finish so he could go home, and never let on. So if you are looking for an apartment at this property I highly recommend working with Gary","1319":"Best.  Donuts.  Ever.  Just amazing.  Great selection, great flavors, great portions (large donuts).  \n\nThe only thing I would recommend for this location is that they clean the store.  It's in the middle of the drinking hot spot - 6th Street - so loads of loaded people come in for donuts, which is fine, but the place reflects that.  It's looking a little rundown and the donut cases are dirtied with old swipes of frosting, the tables are sticky, the floors are sticky.  Doesn't show this amazing product too well.","1320":"Windy City is by far my favorite pizza joint in dot. I always order the Hawaiian pizza and Hawaiian wings and am never disappointed by the flavor, and amount of topping on the pizza. Staff is always pleasant on the phone and upon pickup. When ordering delivery the service is always speedy and the food is still piping hot! Bravo Windy City! I will be a loyal customer as long as I am living in this city!","1321":"Wouldn't let someone in with a green card because it wasn't an acceptable ID to their head bouncer. Unacceptable.","1322":"I love this place! I've been here multiple times so I can say they've earned their five stars.\n\nIt's small with a cozy atmosphere in the winter and open and airy in nice weather. Their cocktails are great, they make them with heart and they are a buck or two cheaper than Woodsman, Tannery or Tabor Tavern. \n\nThe bartenders are very, very sociable and nice - and they love talking about cocktails! This is a big plus in Portland where many with a bar like this are too snooty to chat. Even when it's slammed they are still friendly. \n\nOnly con: they took their cocktail menu from about 60 drinks to around 20. Please bring back the big menu!\n\nHighly recommend!","1323":"Justin and his team did an amazing job on our two cars. His team was fast and they were there right on time. Our cars haven't been this clean since we bought them. Great job and great value for what you get. I will definitely be using them again.","1324":"First time in Boston and wanted some clam chowder. I thought it was pretty good. I liked that it didn't have any celery in it and it wasn't too salty. I also got the grilled lobster which I felt was priced averagely, but not worth it. Just a lobster and a piece of corn...I was not full at all! But decor is nice and the service was good for a busy night.","1325":"Before even trying anything, the service was already unwelcoming. Seemed annoyed when we asked what flavor the cupcakes were, since they had no sign in front of them. We had a canoli, lobster pastry, and a cupcake. Everything was overly sweet. The peanut butter cupcake was probably the tastiest item we chose. Probably would not come back.","1326":"I am so glad I am not a vegetarian and I live in Dallas....because Nueva Ondas Chicharron Gorditas are addictive and must be spiced with crack. I went to Austin for the weekend and ended up going there twice to eat them and brought some back to the room for an after hours drunk snack!! ...This is the only place I know of that doesn't stew the pork skin in the salsa all day long...they actually marry the two to order so the skin is still crispy....mmmmmm\nOh and I have to give honorable mention to the Al Pastor. The pork was chunky and laden with red sauce and pineapple chunks.\nOne more thing you gotta try there is their green sauce...it's got a big kick, but the flavor is outta this world. \nAfter my  weekend in Nueva Onda....oops I mean Austin it's time to hit  the gym!!","1327":"Time after time they amaze me. Freshest food, best service, friendliest staff...\n\nThe best sushi in town. Their creativity also extends to the items on the regular menu, each item as pretty as it is delicious. \n\nThis is an extrodinary dining experience every single visit.","1328":"I wouldn't change my decision to go to Northeastern even if I had the chance to do it all over again.  The co-op program is irreplaceable, especially as a business major.  I've had three amazing co-ops and have been offered a great job for after graduation.  The teachers seem to genuinely care about the students, as do the co-op advisors.  The academic advisors don't seem as concerned, but I also think it's due to their hectic schedules and the amount of students they need to worry about.  If I could do it all over again, I would! The school really prepares you for the business world, through the co-op program, and through the courses. Between projects, team projects, and presentations, you will become comfortable talking in front of large groups and becoming a true business person.","1329":"I like this place. She is experienced and was able to alter my skirt when I showed up and finished within half an hour. She said that if I ever needed to tighten or loosen it again, it will be easy for her to do. The place is in the basement of the mit student Center so it is convenient. Don't forget to bring cash!!","1330":"I love Inner Strength!  I sweat my ass off and after class my muscles feel like they got a good workout but also are relaxed from the stretching in the heat.  \n\nMy first class here I didn't realize it was a heated studio and didn't have a towel to put over my mat.  Don't make this mistake, otherwise you will be slipping all over your mat because it will be soaked in sweat in the first 15 minutes.  Bring a towel both for your mat and second small one to wipe your sweat!\n\nI like to hit up Adam's class on Sunday late afternoon or Lara's slow flow class on Monday nights.  Adam's classes are a great workout, which is awesome.  I know if I go to his classes often I will get pretty strong and toned, but he also keeps you centered mentally.  It's great.  Lara's classes are great as well - I feel like I am going to therapy when I leave her classes because I feel good physically but also mentally\/spiritually.  All of the instructors talk during class, but I especially like her vibe!  I've only taken one of Rebecca's classes, but it was a lot of fun - she's almost playful with the poses and she keeps it pretty light.  She does a good job describing the poses too.  So far, every instructor I have gone to have been great and I like that they each have their own distinct style and personality, so I tend to pick which class to go to depending on what I'm looking to get out of the class.  \n\nSometimes the parking lot is a bit of a zoo, especially during the time when everyone is leaving the previous class and everyone going to the next class is waiting for their spots.  \n\nAnyway, I am loving this place so if you're curious at all, just take a class or two and ENJOY!","1331":"Went here Saturday for dinner, and it was actually pretty full, which was good to see.  My shrimp tacos were pretty large (I got two of them) and the seafood soup was chock full of shrimp and avocado.  I must commend the girl there for being really nice after our 2 year old smashed a bottle of hotsauce on the floor under the table. \n\nThe chicken tacos are pretty average, but the fish and shrimp are really good, and these are what I come here for.","1332":"I actually enjoy living here. Sure, the prices are a bit high but taking into account the fantastic location (super close to Kendall T stop, walking distance from various restaurants and the Cambridgeside Galleria) plus how well-kept the building is, I'm rather content. My maintenance orders have always been completed in a timely fashion, the sidewalks are well-cleared of snow, and I haven't had any issues with mail or packages. Also haven't had issues with neighbor-related noise and the monthly events are a nice touch.","1333":"Great service - they are very nice here. Ingredients are all fresh (veggies look like actually veggies and not oily). Al pastor is great meat to try and spicey chicken is the most popular (it is medium spicey). Guac and sour cream do cost extra and may not be worth it to add all of them.","1334":"Really good XLB - delicate yet structurally intact, rich broth inside. \n\nThe pan fried dumplings weren't up to the same standard, but were still tasty!","1335":"I had high hopes for this store but their selection is really weak.  The prices are really high. Their play area is decent but that's about it. They need a greater selection of average priced toys so you can actually buy something affordable.  We were looking for little toy animals to play with that they only had wooden toys.  Grasshopper has a much better selection for the similar price point. Expand your selection please and offer more affordable selections.","1336":"We usually frequent Menchies on Sawmill, but didn't have time today so thought we would try something a little different.  We were disappointed.  The flavor offerings were few, the taste of the yogurt wasn't nearly as good, machines were out of order and the restrooms were nasty.  We will make sure to leave enough time to head to Sawmill Menchies from now on....","1337":"I love this place, I am obsessed with the lamb plate and my husband always gets the pepperoni pizza (he's a picky eater). One of my favorite places nearby. I have also gotten the lamb gyro but prefer the plate as you also get dolmas.","1338":"* Organic food delivery in Vancouver has at least 4 competitors, and this is perhaps now my favourite. *\n\nOk, since Ladybug has sadly been having problems with the quality and accuracy lately (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/ladybug-organics-home-delivery-service-and-store-surrey#hrid:x1siIpX-AQ-T_30XwQEaMw) decided to try out Green Earth to see how they compare.  I feel like I'm cheating though!  \n\nAfter 2 weeks of the service (my organic delivery secret affair!) here are my impressions:\n\n- The ordering system is much more efficient and easy to complete.  Basically a much better website with streamlined choices.\n\n- I love how they have a recommended bin each week with the freshest produce for the week, and how much this changes from week to week to keep you constantly getting different items and keeping things interesting.\n\n- They are VERY good at only listing the produce and fruit that is actually available when you are ordering so no missing items and\/or substitutions.\n\n- They simplify their choices, so they don't offer 4 or 5 different kinds of apples for instance.  But each week they have 1 or 2 (and actually have them!).  \n\n- The quality of the produce has been on par or superior with that from Ladybug.  Been enjoying some of the sweetest carrots, creamiest sweet potatoes, non-bitter artichokes, delicious locally baked granola, crispy flavourful fuji apples, most flavour packed broccoli that I have had for a long time along with everything else.\n\n- I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5% discount (milk, eggs, etc.).\n\n- Their customer service is really on top of things.  They are very proactive and contact you quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope this continues, and as long as it does I think it will be Green Earth going forward!  (Sorry my dear Ladybug!)","1339":"This is a nice surprise in powerhouse sq. The volume of food is a great value, the Bao bao's are amazing and you get like 10 dumplings in an order!","1340":"THANKFULLY THIS PLACE IS NOW OUT OF BUSINESS!  \n\n*** However, please do not associate this Express location with the ACTUAL Athens Pizza Restaurant farther down Clairmont.  The restaurant is wonderful as always. From what I gather, this crappy express location was NOT owned by the same people as the actual restaurant (at least for the last several years it wasn't).","1341":"I've been on a hiatus when it comes to writing reviews for a while now but I felt a place like this deserves the most attention it can get. Although I don't have many followers on here,  I'm hoping the couple of them that do see this will visit and tell their followers about it and so on and so on.\n \nThis small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. \n\nWe chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. \n\nAll in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have. So I highly recommend it, please give it a shot, and tell more people about them cause small places like these deserve more attention than the bigger ones everyone already knows.","1342":"Very pleasant staff and beautiful selection of cards, small gifts, journals, and stuffed animals.  Love this store everywhere but this store, although not the largest, has a lot of variety and is laid out.","1343":"I've been for lunch twice now and can sum it up in three simple words:  fast, cheap, good.  \n\nThe end.","1344":"The atmosphere is great for drinks but I'd say its a little overpriced for what it is. The poutine is good and worth it. I got the rabbit tacos and the rabbit was a little grainy and the tacos were basic. I think they could have been better.","1345":"I truly loved having dinner here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago.  The bruschetta was the best we'd had in our lives... even soon after a long summer trip to Italy.  I wish we had tried the calamari! Next time...\n\nThe Maine crab-stuffed tortellini was incredible--perfect texture, softly balanced sauce--not too creamy, not to heavy but light and airy in unison with the fluffy light texture of the crabmeat.  Divine.\n\nThe service was really impeccable.  They run a tight ship there and our waiter was kind, thoughtful, and extremely attentive.\n\nI hope that the next time we visit Posto is just as good!","1346":"They claim delivery, but about twenty minutes after I placed an order with Eat24, they called to say that \"they couldn't deliver\" (never heard that from a pizza place before). Called back, placed on hold for quite a while, they called on the other line unaware that I was on hold with them already, and after having to repeat myself several times, was told she'd call to tell them I'd pick it up. So I'm anxious to see if the food is good - looks good - but really wasn't looking forward to leaving tonight. Hopefully it's worth it.\n\nIf you guys are going to offer delivery - offer delivery. There's got to be a way to NOT accept orders if delivery isn't available.","1347":"This is the best bottled kombucha I've ever had. It is smooth and has a perfect balance of flavors. My favorite is the lavender lemonade. It's so good we now sell Lion Heart at our massage practice. The owners are also very helpful and friendly.","1348":"Amanda is amazing!!! Talk about anticipating ALL of our needs!  From having the external heater turned on as we were arriving to making sure we never had an empty cocktail, we had a great time and Amanda was part of the reason.  Add in some awesome food and it's a combination for a wonderful night!","1349":"Always greeted with a smile and pleasant, prompt service.\nThey're open to some substitutions which is nice. The food is great and the containers, utensils, cups, etc are all at the very least commercially compostable. I'm a big fan of the coconut pork paired with ginger mat\u0413\u00a9 tea with a cookie to boot. All the omnomnom noms for this place. The price is a little bit up there but it's not a deterrent for me. If you frequent this place,definitely sign up for the loyalty program.","1350":"Rich was awesome! He helped us with our old mice-ridden house. Looking forward to a more peaceful existence thanks to B&B.","1351":"The Enormous Room is one of those places everyone should try because it's different than any other bar in Boston. What the Enormous Room does offer is something rare, but something people who are familiar with Chicago's nightlife can appreciate. \n\nIt's a lounge with a good DJ. It provides a semi-upscale, hip atmosphere for drinking, hanging out with friends and even dancing, but be sure to arrive early because the interior space resembles what would happen if a Miami nightclub and a hooka bar had a bastard child and to say seating is limited, is a gross understatement. \n\nThe deep, soft couches, pillows and overstuffed chairs lining the exposed brick walls make seating very limited. The only bar is really a window in the back of the club where waitstaff shuffle back and forth taking drink orders and generally creating poor traffic flow. \n\nMy recommendation would be to arrive early with a group of friends and claim a good space or for the more adventurous couple\/date, grab a good spot and order some of the tasty appetizers and watch all the fresh Nike kids work on their break dancing routines.  I like this place but if you don't feel like standing around and waiting for drinks, then this probably isn't for you without prior planning.","1352":"The only spot in China Town where I get Banh Mi.\n\nThey make the sandwiches really good, good bread, good meats, and pickled veggies-I usually just go for the cold-cut combo. They will ask if you want it spicy (I usually don't, but you can).\n\nThere's only one table in there so order to go.\n\nCASH ONLY","1353":"Great service at a great price. Had Pete the owner come to my house to check why my A\/C wasn't cooling, within 5 minutes he had us up and running for less than $150.00. Prior to having him come out my wife received a $1000.00 quote for the same repair. Since the service was so good we hired him to do full install on our business. Again great experience and great value. Thanks again Pete for all of your help.","1354":"I've called at least 10 times in the past 3 days (to only receive voicemail) and left multiple messages to confirm my appointment. No response. Horrible customer service!","1355":"The food is ok. Gouda mac and cheese doesn't taste like gouda and was dry. The yard burger was good with the jam, but my husband's dirty south was ok. The mac and cheese has minimal flavor. He asked us if we wanted the burgers med well and we both said medium and still got them overcooked.","1356":"Friday Night we decided to go out to dinner and since we had heard good things about Fish Daddy's in Pflugerville, we thought we would go for an early dinner and then E could be home in time for football.\nWe have had friends and my brother (who eats there when he is in town) tell us good reviews, however, our experience wasn't as great as theirs.\n\nStrawberry Margarita -- a drizzle of strawberry does not turn a regular margarita into a strawberry one. It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.\n\nSeafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.\n\nKid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.\n\nRed Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it\nSteamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting\n\nJalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.\n\nWe don't plan on going back again. Not sure if they were having a bad night in the kitchen or what but we weren't impressed and the customer service was okay but not enough to make us want to try it again.","1357":"Alexis helped me tonight, great service. Recommended for late night. I'm right down the road and felt like ordering a late night pizza. She made it quick and easy. A+!","1358":"First time here. Happy to say that the food,  the service,  and there music were great!  \n\nAppetizer : Really good fried pickles... And that says a lot from me because I don't like pickles outside of a hamburger bun! \n\nMeal:  Vanbarry's Bacon Jam burger. The burger was perfectly cooked (rare-medium). The beef was high quality. The bacon jam has kind of a sweetness that offset the bacon's salty side. Kind of a caramelized taste. The blue cheese was perfect with it. I decided to try the sweet potato salad as my side,  because I've never heard of it. It was really sweet and creamy. It was really tasty but not quite as chunky as I prefer for my potato salad. The flavor was great and I'd definitely have it again. \n\nOh, the beer was cold and good too! :-)  \n\nAs an aside,  the band\/singer was really good! Kind of a Dave Matthews type. Great voice. I missed his name but I told my wife thst I could see making Sundays on the open patio a regular event to listen to enjoy the music and food. \n\nCertainly a place we will return to! Highly recommend it!","1359":"I am a sucker for ice cream, but JP licks seriously have good ice cream.  Service was friendly too.  I asked for 2 fav for taste (in same request).  The person smile and friendly.  No attitude.  I had Coconut Vanilla sorbet.  It was like so creamy almost like ice cream. And you can taste the REAL vanilla.  Good job!","1360":"I'm feeling sad.  I just got two ricotta cannoli, and neither of them were filled in the middle.  It's not like it used to be.  The Modern was my go-to for many, many years, but I'm not sure what I'll do now.","1361":"I have been wanting to try this place since they reopened. I had a day off and decided to go have lunch. \nThe place has a really nice decor, friendly staff and the service was quick. I sat at the bar and was greeted by the owner I believe. There was a woman sitting next to me that apparently comes several times a week. She made some recommendations and I decided on the Thai Basil Rice with chicken. Their lunch specials  come with a soup, which was Tom Kha that day. It was delicious and my meal came not long after I was finished with the soup. Some of the reviews said that the portions were small. I didn't have that experience. My dish was huge and I had enough to take home for two more servings. My meal was very good. I walked out with a bill of $11.31 plus tip, not bad for all of the food and a tea. I will definitely be back.","1362":"Fantastic little spot in SE! Amazing food - I highly recommend the burritos and the taco bowl. Service is quick and friendly, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Great little outdoor patio & off-street parking is available.\nThey also have a stage and host shows regularly, and the shows start early enough that you can get out & see friends and still get home at a decent hour!","1363":"Super live club! Last time I went the DJ was killing it the whole night had everyone super turnt. Music is loud and they have a big led screen with trippy motions goin all night to the music.","1364":"We visited here for my friends birthday. We had 12 people and 2 kids. We received wonderful service. I highly recommend the Violet Love Martini! Will be back for that drink for sure. Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere.","1365":"Hah! They shut down!\n\nSCORE:\nJane: 7000000\nJasmine Sola: 0","1366":"My friends and I came here after bailing on Waffle Window due to a lack of seats and then bailing on Cup & Saucer because of a long wait. We asked if they could seat 7, not feeling too optimistic but were told it wouldn't be a problem, they would just put us in the back (this place is way bigger than it looks from the outside). We retrieved our friends from outside and headed straight back. \nThe service was a little disorganized, but I'm not expecting perfection when we spring a bunch of people on them at the last minute at a busy time. Overall, I think we were helped by 4 different people and they were all pretty great, happily giving us their opinions.\nThe food came out with surprisingly little wait and it was so dang good. Everyone at the table was pleased. The potatoes au gratin seemed to be a particular hit. I will definitely be back to try their sweet crepes since everyone at the table went with savory this time around. I'm excited to have a new restaurant in the area that I can depend on.","1367":"It's hard to find a Japanese restaurant in Vancouver that doesn't just sell sushi so I was elated to find out about Marulilu. I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. \n\nThe okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! \n\nThe omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! \n\nI also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. \n\nAll in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices! The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water. However, it's one of the few places that serve okonomiyaki in Vancouver so it would still be worth a visit.","1368":"Very welcoming staff.  Feels like you are at your best friends house and you just had a slumber party and they are making you breakfast in the morning.  It's small inside and definitely a locals portland diner. Good food, good prices, good people.","1369":"My haircut experience here was odd. Odd doesn't mean bad. Just odd.\nI went in for a haircut today. The hairdresser was a no-nonsense looking older man, who did not even slightly appear to be gay, so my first thought, sexist as it may be, was \"Oh no, he's going to destroy my hair.\" But I decided to stay, anyway. I sat down in the shampoo chair, and the hairdresser dude proceeded to massage my scalp as he washed my hair. Like REALLY REALLY massage my scalp. I didn't know hair salons even did stuff like that. It wasn't bad, but I would have appreciated a heads-up. He should have said, \"Hey, I'm about to give you a vigorous scalp massage. Hold on to your britches.\" Instead, it was a surprise, so it was awkward.\nI showed him a picture of what I wanted. He cut my hair a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but that's not a huge deal as long as the layers line up correctly. I made the mistake of saying I like it curly-- cause I do, but most hairdressers think that means they can take a round brush and make you look like a juvenile beauty pageant contestant. I ended up stopping him halfway and saying, \"Hey, just run a blow dryer through it, I prefer my natural curls.\" So he did, and it looked fine. I'm lukewarm about the haircut for now, but it might look better in the morning once I wash it.","1370":"$3 banh mi, other readymade meals like curry chicken, BBQ pork w\/ cucumber and sweet&sour sauce, egg noodles w\/ char siu pork, kept warm in plastic containers. The idea is similar to Woorijip in NYC's K-town. \n\nI will be getting food here as a study break more often. Take it to go, it's cheap and fast.","1371":"Over priced mediocre food.  Poor slow service.  This is my third and last visit to this restaurant.  The food was cold.  One undercooked.  Total rip off.","1372":"Third time here, ordered take out. Pad See Ew was amazing! They put it in an aluminum tray and plastic lid with cardboard bottom, so it stayed warm for the journey home. Fast, easy, decent price.","1373":"I normally get pretty stuffed for cheap at Cajun\/Southern joints because of the affordable portion sizes, but here, the food was a bit steep.  More food=more stars.  They would have gotten 4 from me had they stretched my meal with maybe another scoop of 2 or rice per dish.\n\nI had the etouffee and gumbo.  Each came with a small scoop of rice.  The liquid to-go containers were extremely nice.  They were large, tightly sealed plastic boxes that did not leak any of that Louisianian goodness.  That is probably the last time I will ever write a review about to-go packaging... but I was very impressed.\n\nThe crawfish etouffee was a little lighter than most.  It was a more tomato-y type sauce.  It was red, slightly tangy, and there was plenty of tender crawfish swimming around.  It was not as flavorful as some of the others I have had before, but it would have been a great pasta sauce or something.\n\nThe gumbo was a little runnier than I prefer.  It was plenty dark, but it lacked that rich flavor.  I classify it as a soup in my book, but it is definitely a flavorful soup.  There was a little too much sausage, as I prefer my gumbo ratio to lean heavier on the seafood side.  The chicken meat was extremely tender and tasty, though.  There was some tender shrimp mixed in also.\n\nCrazy Cajun offers solid Cajun food, but I would like a little bit more food and some zippier flavor.  Do check it out if you are in the Asian part of town and are hankerin' for some non-Asian food... although the guy that runs CC is Asian!  Who would have thought?","1374":"So, myself and five friends decided to try the famous Wahlburgers. We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. \n\nWe ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. \n\nAs we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. \n\nWe went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. \n\nHonestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. \n\nWithin a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. \n\nIf I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price. \n\nSorry guys, I didn't want to do this. Don't build anymore of these places as nobody from your family knows what is going on.","1375":"Came here for the Austin passbook deal. Buy one get one free deal for a grilled cheese and a side, not bad! The location is adorable. Right off Congress in the shade, small picnic tables and a few chairs. It's right next to the Austin Juice trailer. (Which is also in my passbook, I plan to try that soon!)\n\nWe ordered the Croque-Madame. And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalape\u0413\u00b1o cream cilantro sauce. \n\nIt was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. \n\nOur custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce. I highly recommend the jalape\u0413\u00b1o cream cilantro sauce.  It wasn't spicy to me at all but it had an amazing flavor. I'm a sucker for anything cilantro. \n\n*The sourdough bread did get a little soggy, but it didn't bother me (might bother others). The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*\n\nOur sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good. I think having tomato soup at a grilled cheese trailer is a great idea. \n\nI'd definitely go back to try a different combination or a different sandwich. The ones we got were really good, but I'm looking for that one to be blown away by. =]","1376":"I just want to let everyone know that I was completely correct in that no one from Lucky Strike had contacted me to apologize for our terrible experience. We will not be visiting them again and will ensure that we let anyone know who asks how terrible their service is.","1377":"If you are a fan of buffets and soups and salads, this place is for you!  Heck - if you're a fan homemade tasting food, this place is for you!\n\nThis Sweet Tomatoes is located at the end of a lack-luster shopping center, so it can be difficult to find if you've never been here.  But once you walk inside, you are greeted by the salad buffet and a carpet with tomatoes printed on it (these people take their veggies seriously!).\n\nYou choose your salads and toppings prior to paying.  Patrons sit themselves in either tables or booths and the soups, bakery options, pasta, fresh fruit and ice cream are located in the back and you can go up as many times as you want to sample the many fresh and yummy offerings.\n\nMy favorite part of the buffet are the soups and pastas - so many choices - creamy and cheesey gooey macaroni and cheese and two other options that change every so often!  Also, there are certain soups and salads highlighted (and changed) each month.  For instance, in March, the theme is Latin flavors.  The bread options are abundant as well.  For example, when I last went to Sweet Tomatoes, there were four types of Focaccia bread (and they all had some type of cheese on them, so of course, I had to try them all!), muffins and biscuits.  They also carry Gluten Free and Vegan options, which is a plus.","1378":"Admittedly, some dishes here are hit or miss. The hits, WAY MORE than make up for the misses. The Khao Soi is the best I've ever had,and I've had supposedly the best while visiting Thailand! Very friendly and fast service in the this lovely little hole in the wall.","1379":"Service was a bit of a disaster operationally, but the food and ambiance are top notch (for Ethiopian).\n\nI had made a reservation, but it apparently disappeared and I had to wait with all the plebes.  I was seated relatively quickly after, and servers were pleasant.  I went with the Veggie platter and a salad.  Adding the salad was a mistake.  They brought the salad first,  which ended up delaying the main veggie platter especially long.  They even brought the check in between!  I probably had about 50 calories to start, so was a little annoyed.\n\nThe veggie platter itself was very good, and different from your usual Ethiopian fare.  I found it a little spicier than usual, which was a plus.  They have some additional cold dishes including beets, which were a strong point.\n\nTheir injera is very pleasing to the Ethiopian neophyte, since it is soft and spongey and cut with wheat, so with less teff = less sourness.  That said, the gluten content goes up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ambiance, which was large, hipster, and fun.  They're very busy with good reason, the food is delicious an affordably priced.  I pigged out and still my check was maybe $20.\n\nI get the impression the meat dishes are the stronger suit here.  A lot of people were oohing and awing over the beef tips.","1380":"I have been coming here for years.  the waffle is the same awesome quality year after year and the owners are just a joy to be with.  They have started baking breads and those are simply irresistible just like their waffles.  do yourself a favor and check this place out no matter where you live!  a must visit when in Stevenson.","1381":"I must've ordered incorrectly because I ordered a grilled chicken salad with hummus and got a sandwich instead. Whatever, it wasn't bad but wasn't my favorite thing either.","1382":"Went here for a snack and my boyfriend and I tried the Kofta Saj, which is a ground beef, lettuce and tomato wrap with tatziki sauce. So good! Highly recommend. Service was great as well.","1383":"Very impressed with the prompt service and super-friendly staff!  Love the convenient location too; they share a parking structure with Freddy's, so you can pop in, put in your order, and go grocery shopping while the pizza is being made. Doesn't get any fresher than that!","1384":"This place is super yummy. I come here all the time and they never disappoint. The only complaint I have is I wish that they always offered there eggs Benedict because they only have it on the weekends.","1385":"Crispy coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp scampi amazing, awesome mango slushy an ultimate margarita best times ever! Did I mention the live music Saturday night, reggaes the best!","1386":"Food was absolutely superb from start to finish. Just incredible. And extremely reasonable for the quality. Including reasonable ($65) bottle of wine. The meal for 3 was $210 pre-tip. \n\nSadly our awful waitress was curt and forgot that we ordered 2 sides (we never got them and I didn't ask for them a second time or remind her as once we saw the entr\u0413\u00a9es and realized we probably didn't need them). But she never mentioned it for the rest of the night. I also would have liked coffee with dessert but none was offered. It cost her in the tip but we still had a wonderful time. \n\nHighy recommend the cavatelle and the ravioli for starter, the scallops and halibut for entr\u0413\u00a9es.  The calimari was good, not as good as the other starters and the veal was very good, but again, not as good as the others entr\u0413\u00a9es.  The calimari and veal were NOT bad, they were very good, it's just the others were absolutely outstanding! \n\nPanna cotta and chocolate lava cake w\/ice cream was out.of.this.world! Love this little gem and will be back. We'll just ask for a different waitress.","1387":"These guys rocked! They gave me a courtesy call 30 minutes before showing up and didn't waste any time getting started. They finished my move in the two hour slot I had planned on and were positive and upbeat the entire time. Not only was the service affordable, but I actually had a great moving experience (which I didn't think was possible!) My movers were Luis and Jonathan, and they were phenomenal. True professionals with laid back attitudes. I'd highly recommend them and will use them next time i move.","1388":"For what it is, you can get some great deals here. If you aren't careful, you could also end up spending more on something than it is actually worth. They charge by the pound so if it's a crappy item but it weighs a lot, you will pay a fortune for it. As a schoolteacher though, I love that the children's books are only $.25. Another downside is it's $1.69 a pound for the first 25 pounds. At about the 15 pound mark, it costs more than 25 pounds resulting in putting unwanted items in your cart so you pay less.","1389":"So my third time coming here in the past 2 weeks:\n\nI'm a fitness buff and as such I do not eat out a lot. The two allowances for this rule are coffee and sushi. Fish Market has now snagged my \"Go to Sushi Spot\" award.\n\nI'd learned a valuable lesson years ago when I had gone to a restaurant for the first time and gotten rather mediocre food. I didn't go back for over a year even though it was right next to my apartment. I went back and BOOOOM best dinner of the year that night.\n\nThis is a reason I withhold my reviews until I've been to an establishment a minimum of 2 times. Being my 3rd time at Fish Market, I must say this place is a go to spot.\n\n1) It's tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids \"HEEY MORE SAHKIIII\". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.\n\n2) I've gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude. She's always super sweet and attentive, even promoting their \"Free ice cream\" promo while my lady and I were discussing whether or not she wanted some ice cream.\n\n3) My sushi\/ meals here have so far been consitently great. I always get a \"clean\" fresh taste from my food here. It is what I now expect. If the sushi were priced higher, as it is at some restaurants, I would not hate it due to the great quality. I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.\n\n4) Price is great. It's also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, don't hate when I get my food before you.","1390":"I drove from Knoxville to get Japanese hair straightening (thermal reconditioning) done. It was worth the drive. Bryan was very nice and the service was awesome. Now I could wash my hair and just let it air dry and it will be straight. Don't need to spend an hour straightening my hair anymore.","1391":"I really love the Cuban coffee that I had there. The jerk chicken salad was good. I really like my experience there. I love the juices there, it makes me feel like I am in the Caribbean drinking juice.","1392":"I've been there at least 10 times. The eggplant parmesan is  splendid. Generous portions. Pretty good salads, too. I think for the price it's a great lunch or lite dinner place. Their honey mustard dressing is the best I've had.","1393":"If you ever have a chance to visit Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park. Yak & Yeti Restaurant is another good choice for you when you are looking for a good food and good service. \n\nYak & Yeti is a fine table-service dining which will serve you during lunch and dinner.\nAnd this restaurant is base of Mt. Everest in the small town of Anandapur. This place serves Asian fusion ( Combines flavor from China, India and Nepal) \n\nMy fianc\u0413\u00a9, our godson and I had a wonderful meal there at Yak and Yeti Restaurant. \nWe started with Wok-Fried green beans, House Salad, and Thai Chili Chicken Wings as our appetizers. These dishes were so wonderful. Then we had Combo (shrimp and Chicken) Lo Mein , saut\u0413\u00a9ed egg noodles, carrots, cabbage, green onions and bean sprouts for our main dish. I would say, we really loved the food and this place. We got a really nice service as well.   \n\nToo bad, this place is too far a way from me to visit often. Otherwise I will be a big fan.\n\nDon't miss out during you visit Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park, Yak & Yeti Restaurant is a hit!","1394":"Not much can be added about Breakfast @ Val's that hasn't already been committed to cyberspace. We loved the food there, and affirm that the portions are huge, the overall value is very good (Hey! you can't spell 'value' w\/o the letters V-A-L), and the service, warm and personable. Val has been on her game in the Couve for about 2.5 years now, after refining her most sacred shao-lin technique with her hot pots, in downtown Portland \"for about 15-16 years.\"\n\nDeserving special mention from the menu were the triple-decker Ruebenator, and the philly cheese-steak scramble. So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again.\n\n\nThe one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider  later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades.  If Stepping Stone can do it, you most definitely can dooo it.\n\nVal and co: you're a shining star, no matter who you are. Shining bright to see, what you could truly be...","1395":"We were on a road trip and stopped in for breakfast. The wait wasn't too bad, and we were sat at our table. My coffee mug had lipstick on it and our server would not look at me as I was calling out, \"ma'am, ma'am?\" Trying to get a fresh cup. She finally acknowledged me and brought a fresh cup. I ordered a fit skillet meal that was topped with avocado... it came out with rotten avocado slices that were clearly not edible. Our server brought me more slices from the SAME AVOCADO!! I left it on the plate right at the edge of the table and she ignored it, never checking to see if it was ok. Our kids' meals were not as described, and my husband said his was edible but not great. By the end we asked to speak with the manager to let them know our experience. We are business owners and would like to be given the chance to improve as well... Anyway, she came out and could not have cared less. She tried to make an excuse about the avocado, and then tried to get the conversation over faster by offering us 10% off our ticket. We didn't want that, just an acknowledgement of the errors and maybe some assurance that they would correct them. No luck.","1396":"I thought the food was delicious but I ended up paying the price when I got home. While waiting an hour for my food I was constantly attacked by flying bugs that almost ruined my appetite. I got back to my hotel and ate as much as I could. The entree was huge! The potstickers were just about the best I've ever had but the next day, my stomach paid the price on my decisions to eat this food. Overall it was good, but I don't think I will go there again","1397":"Oh my god, I can't believe people still get services here. I worked at this location years ago and left injured (which no one gave a shit about). I decided to write a review because today, almost 5 years after I left Dosha, I bumped in to an old client downtown who was told that I had left the country. She is one of many customers that they do not hesitate to lie to.\n\nMake no mistake, there are much better salons within walking distance from nearly all Dosha locations. Do your community a favor and do a little research, then spend your hard earned money on a place that treats bit employees well.","1398":"Jon and his crew are top notch!  They went above and beyond, and I will definitely have him come back  to do additional tile work.  Jon is extremely easy to communicate with and my whole experience was easily 5 stars.","1399":"Great hummus and homemade bread, for starters. Comfort food, strong drinks, and not too hard on the wallet! Sometimes, I want great spaghetti and meatballs! My husband always wants lamb chops, and he really likes the chops and risotto here!","1400":"This place NEVER disappoints! Great quality food at reasonable prices!! Sad they took out the arroz con pollo off their menu, it was amazing!!","1401":"This place is cool looking and the food is pretty good. The service was decent we had a new server so I'm not holding her lack of knowledge against her. But the people who were supposed to be training her were  extremely uninterested in what was going on. While my food was good, it was expensive. I think they charge waaay too much for pizza and chicken wings. It also took a while to get our food. We did a carry out, we sat there in the waiting area for a while, walked to another store and came back and it still wasn't ready when we returned. The Restaurant Wasn't busy so unless They were Getting a lot of call ins, i see no Reason for the wait. Overall the place was just ok.","1402":"So, I went to this Cabela's on Black Friday to purchase the Walther PPS.  They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  \n\nNeedless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's.\n\nI do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it.  Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.","1403":"This branch is just like the Roosters over here in Grove City and sometimes it's good to have consistency.  Sometimes you just crave some dumpster wedges or tots and I know I'll always be able to get there.  The chicken tenders are always well cooked and they have a pretty solid drink collection.  Just wish there was ginger ale!","1404":"Good food and pleasant service. Self seating can be a pain sometimes, and parking is usually slim to none in the evenings. Live music was enjoyable. I bring my dogs and sit outside. They always bring me a fresh bowl of water for them, which I appreciate! I would fully recommend this place!","1405":"A slogan should mean something and with Reliable Property Management it does.\nWe have leased from Reliable Property Management for over 2 years and we have received nothing but excellent and professional attention.  If I have a maintenance problem, a simple email to them has resulted in an immediate authorization to arrange for the repair. All upkeep of the property to excellent standards have been met in every way.  I owned a home for many years and now they have made me feel like this is my home. From the owner Terry Godbold, to the staff of Debbie, Bobbi, Connie, and Diann, all of whom have made our first leasing experience very easy and enjoyable. Reliable does say it all with this company.","1406":"We met some friends for drinks in the tap room on a busy Saturday night (at around 10:00PM). The restaurant was hopping, with a short wait for a table. But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables).\n\nThe drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it.\n\nThe bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay).\n\nI noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot. I would suggest parking somewhere central and hoofing it. We also made use of Uber which worked in our favor for the night.","1407":"I had a lovely dinner here with my girlfriends on Tuesday night.  The service was fantastic--friendly, attentive, and informative--and the food was delicious.  I was blown away by how innovative each dish was, from name to plating to taste.  \n\nFavourites of the night:\n- Comfort High (cocktail served hot that is basically holiday cheer in a cup)\n- Wannabe Carbonara (the perfect marriage of Italian and Asian noodles with a creamy, egg sauce)\n- Vegetarians Only (crispy mochi goodness; filling!)\n- Dr. Octopus vs. Mr. Tuna (I've never seen anything like it!)\n- Kickass Rice 2.0 (pork belly aburi that melts in your mouth)\n- Magic Stick (This dessert was so heavenly that we had to order a second one to share.  Imagine a chocolate ganache bar with amazing matcha crumbles and different fruit sauces. Now stop imagining and go to Torafuku to experience it in person.)\n\nI got there at 6:30pm and snagged a booth, but it did start filling up after.  \n\nI'm looking forward to coming back!","1408":"Had a pretty good time last Friday with my sister, husband and brother-in-law.  I am excited that we found a place that we can get away from the hustle and bustle of every day madness and just enjoy some great local musicians.  At times a little too busy, but overall a fun place for us.","1409":"Sometimes you walk into a place and realize that it may be just for you. So when I heard there was a new poutine place in Boston, I said \"Yay!\" When I heard they had a solid craft beer list, I said \"Woo Hoo!\" When I heard four of those craft beers were draft lines, I leapt in the air!\n\nNo frills, great food, great beer, great staff. Small and cozy. Not much bar space. So many Sauses and options you could visit Saus a dozen times and never eat the same thing twice. Which is great because everything I've had was superb. Shaved Brussels sprouts! With bleu cheese and bacon!","1410":"Quite possibly the best restaurant in Atlanta. Always a go to for family birthdays. Excellent wine selection. I could eat the piroshkis for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great setting. Great ownership.","1411":"This place is amazing. Great for dine in and take out. The service is very enjoyable, everyone is friendly and great to talk to. Believe the sign outside-- the lasagna is amazing!!! Definitely recommended.","1412":"I came to this Starbucks a few minutes before closing time. They had thrown out all the coffee and would not serve me. Instead, they sent me to another Starbucks at a Barnes and Noble down the street, claiming it was open late. I drove there and it was closed as well.","1413":"Love love love Gilbert's.  It's such an exotic little place, with a plush mediterranean feel.  Some of the pretty boys from Blake's next door may spill over, but it's definitely more low key and relaxed.  Enjoy your super strong cosmo!\n\nThe food is delicious as well.  The hummus is yummy, and my favorite sandwich is the tender and juicy lamb burger with tzatziki sauce.  Surprisingly enough, the paella for 2 is fabulous.\n\nGreat place all around!","1414":"I'd call this a do-not-miss if you're in downtown Boston for a casual dinner. It was loud and lively with fabulous and fun decor. Our wait wasn't more than 10 minutes at the cocktail tables outside the tent that defines the restaurant, then we were seated next to a nice family with cute kids. Everyone sits at picnic tables and unless you have a large group, plan on sharing your table.\n\nStarters were the crab cakes and drunken shrimp (it doesn't need the chips) -- perfect with the Fisherman's Brew from Glouchester on draft. My dining companion and I split a two pound lobster that was scrumptious. For obvious reasons, you don't get relatively inexpensive lobster on the West Coast, so this was a treat.","1415":"We had an awesome time here celebrating our anniversary.  Our server was so nice, explained the menu, and was attentive.  The atmosphere was low key but fun, and we loved our meals! I had the shrimp and mussels combo with the shakin sauce, and added on corn and potatoes.  I was impressed to see a couple purple potatoes in there!! We had the spicy calamari to start and it was fantastic as well!! I can't wait to come back soon!!","1416":"Second time in a row I've ordered pick up and the\nPizza has been cold. If I'm paying $26 for a pizza I'd expect it to actually be hot when I pick it up. One of the times it wasn't even ready yet when I got there and it was still cold.","1417":"Best Pint of Guinness I've ever had in the USA. Poured properly and well worth the wait.","1418":"This place sounds like a simple sandwich shop but is actually one of my favorite places in Boston. I always took visiting guests here because it has something for everyone. The first time I ate at Parish, I took a chance on the meatloaf sandwich, which normally I would never look at as I'm not a big meatloaf fan. That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too. I'm really into Mac and cheese so I almost always try them at restaurants but usually am disappointed because I can make better, which was not the case here. I'll definitely be paying Parish a visit when I'm back in Boston.","1419":"I'm pretty inexperienced with the vegan world, but have recently become interested in what lowering my animal protein consumption might do for my health. With that said, I've dined twice recently for lunch at Proper Eats. The foremost surprise to me was how well the meal stuck with me. I thought for sure I would be hungry again by 5PM, but that was not the case. Second surprise was just how tasty everything was, especially tempeh which I don't believe I'd ever had before. Overall both meals I had were scrumptious and filling. Last time I was there, one of the employees asked me how my meal was, and this is an important sign that a restaurant takes pride in what they do. Also, I noticed the prices on their organic produce was MUCH more affordable than my local Fred Meyer, so I'm going to be doing some shopping there sometime.","1420":"We booked the Hampton Inn for our wedding room block, and it was better than we could have imagined. The front desk staff was so incredibly friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were larger than expected. Our suite was beautiful, spacious, and quiet. \n\nThe free breakfast buffet was a big hit with guests, and there was a lot of space in the lounge area for everyone to mingle and catch up over breakfast the next day. \n\nOverall, the Hampton Inn exceeded our expectations and helped make our wedding weekend wonderful.","1421":"Amazing location. Classy, great lightung, clean and well mantained. \n\nGreat fresh coffee, and the food is absolutely to to die for!!! Had a bacon wrapped shrimp tapas with a lemon beurre blanc type sauce. Then went on a chicken carnita sandwich on ciabatta!! \nVery reasonable prices...especially if youre looking for a nice meal and a bottle of wine. Good service as well.\n\nIts about type this area got a classy, great quality restaurant thats not ridiculously overpiced (Genuine). \n\nGreat change of pace from the previous rude owners as well.","1422":"My first taste of pho and I have loved it since. Huge portions for a low cost and tremendous taste. I always order #16 and have never been disappointed. Unexpectedly the wings here are some of the best I have ever had. The only contention I have with Le's is the service can be absolutely horrid and you really have to flag down your waiter\/waitress to get service sometimes.","1423":"Lots of healthy food choices, including tons of vegan and vegetarian options. I've never been for breakfast, but apparently that is amazing as well. Much of the food comes from the UBC Farm. . Service is quick and they even serve beer. Prices are decent and there is lots of comfy seating.","1424":"The ladies there were super sweet and also had great ideas for Halloween costumes. Went there in search of a one inch straightner... found a decent one for $80... which we called the 'jay-z\" straightner. It's red, it's long, it brings the heat to 400 degrees! \n\nCute little whole-in-the-wall stores and all kinds of fun wigs!","1425":"So this review is coming from a tourist who has never attended HHN previously, but was extremely excited to experience the Walking Dead and Silent Hill haunted houses as a bonus to our Disney vacation.\n\nIn short, our whole experience at HHN was disastrous. We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.\n\nUniversal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.\n\nUnless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.","1426":"Love this place! The new location is great! I think the services provided are outstanding and recommend this to anyone looking for professional threading and\/or waxing.","1427":"Nice little place near Main. Service is pretty slow (and our dishes arrived at very different times in no particular order so some people were almost done while some of us still didn't have their food). I am not an expert in Peruvian food, but I have to say it was very (too?) rich for me. The dressing in the quinoa salad in particular. \nThe rest of the food was good but always on the rich side, so don't order too much!\nOh, and in terms of playlist expect some Britney Spears, Dido, Avril Lavigne and Bon Jovi...","1428":"Good pizza, with a cult following. Worth a trip out on the blue line. Not the best I've ever had--the crust is too bland and mealy, and the cheese is a little rubbery--but still delicious. The sweet, herby sauce is the best part of this pizza.\r\n\r\nThe price is right (about $10 for eight nice-sized slices). The place is unpleasantly dirty though. My water glass was filthy, and crumbs were everywhere. Friendly service and ultracasual,blue-collar atmosphere.","1429":"Very nice establishment for some evening cocktails and dinner. Haven't had the food yet but I've been to the one in Dunwoody. I think once they get the ambiance right with the music and live performers it will definitely be even more of a hit. Nice wide bar and upscale","1430":"Next time I'm here you will find me in my snuggie.\n\nThere I said it,  it's out there and now and the world knows that not only am I a man of comfort, I'm also a man of style which is why Johnnie Fox's Irish Snug is the perfect little place for me. \n\nTo be honest I'm not a fan of Irish pubs, sure I would love to go to a local pub in Ireland but the term \"Irish pub\" seems to have lost its meaning in this town. I'm glad i did not listen to my inner scepticism because I love this little place.\n\nThe first thing you will notice is the size, it's a small pub where the bar alone takes up half of space with some nice cozy booths in the back. You will feel comfortable as you are, with or without your snuggie. \n\nThe food was a cut above your normal pub menu, those little mini yourkies are the size of mini cupcakes are delicious. The Irish nachos and roast beef sandwich are also very tasty, add these together with some beer and it's a match made in heaven.\n\nI often visit this place during or after work so if you see a guy wearing a collared snuggie (cursed you work dress code!) in the back nursing a beer come say hi!","1431":"The food was outstanding. We had the Wagyu Beef sliders and the baby grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly. The flavors were savory, on point. Great wine list. Had wine from Paso Robles, so amazing. Atmosphere was chill, relaxing with a touch of hipster.","1432":"I have to admit, I dont' really know why I like the Green Briar so much-  it's nothing special and feels slightly contrived, but it does feel like a fairly authentic Irish Pub.  If you are in the neighborhood and need some quick food and a pint, you won't be disapponited unless you are a culinary snob. (I kinda am, but you set expectations based on where you are).  Fact of the matter is, you will see some dude's watching the game, reading a book over a pint,a nd a gaggle of fiddlers practicing thier tunes on any given night.  It's a fun spot for a change of pace if that's whjat you're lookin for.","1433":"I have had a Samsung Galaxy S6 for a little over a year and the home and power buttons randomly stopped working. When I went in for a consultation twice (I wasn't prepared to drop off my phone the first time), both the repair person as well as the people at the front desk 1. explained the process to me step by step 2. was clear about the cost 3. accurately gave me an estimation of how long it would take them to fix it and 4. told me they would contact me if anything we discussed changed. \n\nAfter picking up my phone on time, they told me that because they just needed to clean the phone (there was \"goo\" inside that was causing the button issue) there would be no charge because they didn't really have to \"fix\" anything and was deemed a consultation. WHO DOESN'T CHARGE PEOPLE FOR EVEN A CONSULTATION! I WAS BEYOND SHOCKED AND ECSTATIC since I was ready to buy a new phone! Whatever they were going to charge me for the repair was reasonable which is why I decided to go with them initially, but then the customer service aspect was just the icing on the cake.\n\nIn addition, there was a constant stream of people coming in for all reasons, so apparently it's in the know and I was just late to the party. As long as they can fix my electronic items, I probably won't go anywhere else and frankly you shouldn't either. And who doesn't like to shop local! THANKS A TON!","1434":"My boyfriend and I came here after spending time at Bracket  Town during the NCAA Final Four Weekend here in Atlanta.  It was very quiet and he atmosphere was nice and relaxing. The food came out hot. The services was great.","1435":"So I got two slices here, ( the only kind which actually matter) a cheese and a pepperoni. Man, I just gotta say this is some of the best NY style pizza I've had in Portland in a long while. Killer pepperoni! Flavorful and a bit spicy ('m sick of wimpy, bland greasy pepperoni. Good crust, perfect amount of sauce to crust to cheese. It sucks when the cheese is thicker than the crust and when there isn't enough sauce to balance. Not here! I grew up in NY state and this stuff is the real deal! Can't wait to come back!","1436":"Average family place! Like..super average. Did not smell like a diner...average customer service ..worst pancakes ever..my 90 yr old grandma can cook better than those in her sleep...totally uncooked. Anyway...\n\nTo the good part... It is cheaper and there is no wait or queue...now i know why.\n\nWe tried a club sandwich, pancakes, eggs Benny, and coffee.","1437":"Great interesting dishes which are great to share.  Perfect place for a small group dinner with rounds of tapas and drinks.  Our service was spot on, and the atmosphere is perfect with the great deck.","1438":"There are only two restaurants in Austin I can go every week and not get sick of it, this and Din Ho. Okay, well after two years maybe I'm not as impressed as I used to be, but for god sakes, we're talking every Friday for two-three years?. I go here for lots of reasons. I can't get nepolitos (sp?) and plantains at almost any other Mexican restaurants in Austin. I also can't find pozole almost anywhere else! Their menu is split up into authentic interior Mexican and Tex-Mex, which is perfect. I'm a healthy eater and fitness professional, my boyfriend is a fast food connoisseur. I usually get the fish yucateco and he gets one of their four pechugas (again, sp?). If we bring a friend, they're usually delighted by the avocado margaritas, especially during an hour with drink specials. Any other restaurant almost in Austin, one of us is guaranteed to be unhappy. I have never had problems with the service and would recommend to anyone.","1439":"My first time here and the manager treated us like family. I was highly impressed. I had the BBQ, Bacon and Cheese burger with the smash fries. The rosemary adds a little kick to the fries and they were so yummy! The burger was fantastic as well. My dad had the Spinach and Goat Cheese Salad. And according to him he loved it. Next time I'm their I might get it or the other burger I was going to get. The Truffle Mushroom Burger. Well anyway, I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for a high end burger.","1440":"I was wandering down N. Mississippi recently, killing time before a happy hour meet up with some friends, and happened across CD-Game Exchange, so I decided to stop in and browse for a few. The place impressed me quite a bit, and I'll always try to go back and search the racks for a cheap find anytime I'm back in the neighborhood.\n\nI've seen other CD-Game Exchange locations around Portland, and a long time ago I stopped into the Hawthorne location but failed to find the specific discs I was looking for. I think this location on Mississippi is similar in that you probably shouldn't go looking for one specific disc, artist, or game - this is no Everyday Music or Music Millennium.\n\nBut if you're just browsing, it's definitely worth checking them out because they do have a pretty decent selection of used CDs, at really reasonable prices. They have a decent selection of discs priced in the $1-5 range, and more priced a few bucks higher. And the bargain priced discs aren't all from bands of which you've never heard or never want to hear.I managed to score a copy of \"Honey, I'm Homely\" by the Dance Hall Crashers for only $1[!] and it plays just fine.\n\nI'm not really a gamer these days, so I didn't look at their selection or pricing of video games, but if it's anything like their CD inventory it's worth checking out.\n\nThey have a fair return\/buy-back policy which diminishes a little each day you have the CD or game, so if you have a little buyer's remorse you're not completely out of luck.\n\nAs I say, it's not the best place to go searching for that one special CD, but they have enough stuff for you to browse and likely find something you want at very reasonable prices.","1441":"I used Jack from Building Knowledge recently for a potential home purchase in Atlanta and was very impressed. Jack was on time, friendly and knowledgeable, and very thorough. Their final report, which I received in less that 24 hours, was methodical, detailed, accompanied by pictures to make it easier to understand, and encouraged me to call them for any follow up questions. Overall a two thumbs up!","1442":"Great place with very friendly and professional staff. Prices are very reasonable despite being located in an airport. Food is high quality and delicious. This is the best spot to pass some time in Terminal A.","1443":"I think I would go to see just about anybody perform at The Tabernacle.  It's just that great of a music venue.  Small and intimate, yet big enough to attract big acts.  I've seen a lot of shows here including: Guster, John Mayer, Tenacious D, Moby, Ben Folds Five, Ben Folds, Counting Crows, and The Black Crowes.\n\nStanding on the ground floor for a concert is ok... but it's just like any other General Admission venue... you have to keep your ground or else you will probably be pushed to the side or rear of the venue.  The upper balcony is ok (at least you get to sit down) but can be a little nerve wracking because it feels as though you're going to fall off of the balcony at any time.  My favorite place to sit is in the middle section of the first balcony... and they can be hard seats to get, but if you're like me and you really like a band, you will get there early enough and rush up the stairs just to get good seats!","1444":"Not impressed with the burgers at all. There was absolutely no flavor in the burger. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was for the quickness of the service. There also several option to add to a burger that has no flavor. I was so hopeful.","1445":"Found this place and decided to give it try as we usually go to Killer Pihrana sushi downtown. The sushi was okay, decent quality fish. \n\nWe also ordered some rolls which came out better than the nigiri sushi. Hey had also ran out of snapper when we arrived before dinner time. \n\nI felt the service could be better. We were served water at room temperature which sucks cause Texas gets hot ya know? I felt like the only time the server came around was to take orders deliver the food and collect the bill. He was attentive yes but did not take initiative. I would not come back here cause Pirhana sushi is better overall.","1446":"Stopped here for a few drinks before dinner, there were some hits and misses and some ingredients that ran out pretty early in the evening. The appetizers were nicely done though.","1447":"Horrible horrible service. They made us wait for 10 min for them to clear off a table. Then they pulled a reserve sign off of a table and gave it to us. After another 10 min without even being offered a drink, it was time to leave. Never going again.","1448":"I've been for brunch a few times, but I'm sort of meh about brunch. Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.\nThen I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....\n\nThey had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. \n\nThen, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. \n\nWhen I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. \n\nUnlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.","1449":"Loud!!!  Service is usually below par but I guess that's to be expected at a sports bar.  Food is no surprise either...  For a bar.","1450":"I've been here 3 times. Food quality is ok. Food quantity is impressive. Waiters are less than impressive . Building itself is cool. A happy hour drink might come half full. It's a chain..what can I say.","1451":"Back again to dine in this great restaurant. Enjoying some happy hour glasses of Conundrum wine with a large mixed app platter served with the airy lavas and the fried liver. Then on to the mixed grill with extra rice. So good!! You can't forget the \"Sutlac\" A rich and creamy rice pudding served chilled topped with pistachio crumbles. Last but not least. The Turkish Tea. Wonderful. We've eaten here many times. Servers that have made our experience worth another visit are Burak , Enes and Tolga. Thank you all for the humble dining experiences.","1452":"I went ot Bao Asian Fusion again with my family, and although our entrees tasted good, details made me wonder about the quality\/cleanliness of the place.  \nThe water had a funny taste, it might be because of the ice cubes, like sometimes if you don't use them for a while they have that bad flavor.\nWe ordered sushi and also Chinese dishes for each of us.  I wish they'd asked us in what order we wanted the plates. Instead, we got the hot dishes first and then the sushi a few minutes later.  \nLastly, we could not even eat the tiramisu.  Both my daughter and I found it had a strange taste, kind of a chemical taste. It did not look like a Tiramisu either (and I don't blame them, after all, this is not an Italian restaurant), more like a sad little (previously) frozen thing.   \nOverall, the food was good, but next time, if I go back, I'll make sure to ask to get my sushi first, and ask for water without ice cubes (hopefully it will take care of that bad taste.)","1453":"I was just running around Boston trying to find somewhere good to eat and decided to give this place a try.\n\nAtmosphere: it's trendy, intimate and modern. Played great music. The first floor was pretty spacious and the set up was kind of awkward but I didn't mind it.\n\nService: My waitress was so friendly! She offered great tips for what I should order when I couldn't decide and she always checked up on us.\n\nFood: Very limited dinner menu in the restaurant. I got an arugula, feta maple walnut salad with mustard dressing as an appetizer which was a good starter. Then a thin crusted pizza for my entree. It was good, but they gave me the wrong toppings!! My boyfriend got a bleu cheese burger and french fries that he said were very good.\n\nIt was a nice place to just sit and relax before hitting the town but I'd like to try it again to see the club atmosphere!!","1454":"The people who work here have been very friendly and helpful both times that I have gone. I bought a light bulb for a heating lamp that stopped working after a week and they gave me a new one for free. All the animals look especially happy and have adequate space. It is a little pricey but a great store.","1455":"I love their greek chicken salads.  I've had a tuna sub from here once that I wasn't impressed with.  But the salads are really good and the feta is really fresh.  The pizza is typical greek pizza- not my favorite.  Its a little pricey- but it has to be considering the location.  If you live in the neighborhood I would definitely pick it up for an easy dinner, and if you work in the neighborhood it makes a great lunch!","1456":"I have no idea how this hotel has 3 stars, I have stayed twice during busy season and it has been great. The entire hotel from the lobby to the rooms is flat out elegant. The staff is friendly and the rooms are very clean. The view is spectacular unless it is a foggy day.","1457":"I came here with a bunch of ladies, post bar hopping for a bachelorette party.  Not sure what was wrong that night but the inside of the building was extremely hot.  It was more than just uncomfortable.  We shared a few doughnuts and everything was really sweet.  Too sweet for all of us.  The lines were long and slow.  Not worth waiting a long time for.","1458":"Great place for drinks and appetizers late night.  Good bar menu and friendly bar tender.  The spicy pork nachos were awesome. \n\nOnly odd thing is the smell when you come in. Not sure if it cleaning product or something else.... Yikes!   \n\nWill be back hopefully after they clean\/switch cleaners.","1459":"If you are Chinese, there is nothing worth coming for here. The dumplings are very americanized, their boba drinks are pitiful. At more than a dollar per dumpling, you can do better anywhere in Chinatown, or even buying a frozen bag at a grocery store for 1\/4 of the cost.","1460":"Hidden Gem on Buford highway. I had Hugh who was not only talented but had an eye for which hairstyle matched me personally. Really took his time and paid attention to detail. I will pay any price for effort and quality and walked out of there paying the cheapest I've ever paid for a cut in Atlanta. Check them out!","1461":"I visited the Portland Clinic to diagnose and ultimately repair a problem with my ankle. The orthopedists were caring and responsive.","1462":"I'm updating to make clear that I used the Heat Busters in Dallas, TX. I lived there at the time.","1463":"I have been coming here since it opened and the pizza is always amazing. It's pretty much my favorite in Austin and I love the chill south Congress vibe. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!","1464":"I really want to give this place 4 stars but there are a couple things holding me back. \nFirst, the pool table is positioned horribly. One of the corners is right next to a crowded doorway. Not only do you have to be mindful of people, the door itself is in the way. You essentially can't shoot from that corner of the table. An easy fix would be to take that door off entirely and just have an open doorway. \nSecondly, the drinks are pretty watered down. I've ordered a drink at the bar on a weekend and with dinner on a weekday (the sliders are pretty good). Despite the bartender being incredibly friendly during dinner, I was questioning if there was even alcohol in my cocktail (maybe I'm just an alcoholic). While there's no cover at this new location, you'll probably end up spending more on drinks and parking. \nI am impressed that this has remained an actual lesbian bar though. I expected it to be flooded with gay men like all the other gay bars in Midtown. I really want to like this place and make it my new watering hole, but right now it's not at its full potential.","1465":"Where do I start... I would give Zero stars for the apartment and management. First of all, there was no mention of any cleaning or insurance fees when we phoned to confirm our stay and specifically asked for the total amount the morning before we arrived. They added $90+ for cleaning and insurance when we got there and said that the extra fees are displayed somewhere in the fine print on the website where we booked.\n\nThe apartments are so darn old, dusty and has a depressing d\u0413\u00a9cor and inadequate lighting. The furniture looks and feel so cheap perhaps from the early 80s. I could not stop sneezing from the dust in the air and on the furniture. The cable did not work most of the time and there was no WiFi access because the phone line was actually down. The AC did not cool the apartment down and there is a warning on the thermostat not to put below 75F or it will freeze!\n\nThe bathrooms are so outdated with broken tiles in the showers and rust on the air vents.\n\nI will upload some pictures which should speak for themselves.\n\nI was so glad to leave this place after a couple of nights. Never again and certainly nothing magical about these memories!","1466":"Not as good as Mother's or Fuller cafe. Eggs are underdone, even for over easy. Potatoes are very good and I really like the homemade ketchup. The baguettes are great with the jam and butter. Very long line, slightly chaotic wait list and they don't call you so you need to be in the lobby when it's your time. Not too bad.","1467":"(Updated 5\/25\/2013)\n\n\nThe audacity of that poster who thinks those of us who have been insulted by the rude staff are placing \"worthless\" reviews.  Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His \"great\" service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, it's not their fault it's everyone else's. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costello's do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?  When you are in the \"hospitality\" business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having.  Unbelievable!!   \n\nIf you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE!   They also make an excellent dirty martini!  Bartenders and staff are super friendly.  \n\nNow on to the original review:\n\nI haven't been to this place in years.  So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you don't like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I won't ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she's working.  Very disrespectful.  You don't disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! \n\nI ended up leaving there and going to Coco's Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCo's lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! \n\nPeriod!!\n\nIf anyone knows the owner\/s of Costello's PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn't a relation.  They need better staff.  Hell I'll work there and give the patrons service with a f**^n smile!!!","1468":"We have purchased several pieces of top notch quality furniture from Red Snapper and have been beyond pleased. the prices are great. Michael and Jake are extremely knowledgeable and go out of the way to help you find the piece that you are looking for. Definitely our first stop when searching for mid century furniture pieces!","1469":"I haven't made it to a yoga class, yet, but I did do the Yoga Therapy. I'm really glad I went. I also managed to break the reservation system, which led to a hiccup, and the management were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make it right. So, I feel quite good about going here in the future.","1470":"This place is amazing. With an appetizer, one of their pizzas should be enough for two people, so you really can't beat the price. Spectacular location right in the middle of the North End, and they give you a bottle of balsamic glaze! I've only ever had the margherita pizza and the baked ricotta, but they're both good enough that I keep coming back.","1471":"Went for the first time on a rainy Friday night, so kinda empty. I ordered an appetizer and the Saag Paneer... Oh and a Kingfisher. I like my Indian food on fire and it was! However I finished my beer and water and was just left there to suffer in pain! I then dropped my serving spoon the waiter standing across the room glanced and did nothing! \n\nI had enough, marched over to him and said, seriously? I've been sitting there for 20 min with my mouth on fire! He waved his hand at me as to say go back to you table! He then sent another waiter over??? \n\nUgh, I'm sorry but there is way to many \nchoices in Indian food to have to put up with these buffoons.... Never again!","1472":"Longing for some Filipino foods, visited this place and oh yeah, was not disappointed. Ordered, paid, ate and loved it!!! :D","1473":"Located in a not-so-inviting Smyrna retail strip, Siam Square is definitely much more charming on the inside. Take the chance - GO IN!\n\nMy husband and I live around the corner, so we have been here a time or two - or 20.  This is our go-to Thai restaurant in the area.\n\nAppetizers: Chicken Satay - Delicious! OR, go for the combination plate... I haven't been disappointed by an appetizer yet.\n\nEntree: My favorite dishes are the Massaman Curry (of course) and the Spicy Basil Leaves.  The full size dishes are large enough to share or to take home as leftovers - I admit that I have eaten the full dish from time to time.  \n\nSides and such: I absolutely love the cucumber salad and I can't get enough of the cucumber water.  They offer a fried banana dessert that is absolutely amazing.\n\nAtmosphere: Low lighting, booths and tables, huge print of the actual Siam Square, cherry blossom branches in vases, nice Thai dishware with a glass or two from IKEA :)\n\nDeals: You can frequently find Scout Mob and other local deals here, but the food is worth the full price if you can't find a deal (avg $12 - $15 entrees).","1474":"Went here on my trip to Atlanta. The food is absolutely delicious as well as it makes a lovely date night spot.","1475":"FANTASTIC FOOD & SERVICE!  I would go here once a week if I could.  I love the atmosphere and the food so so much.  Have tried tons of stuff on the menu and I love it all.  Always fabulous service.  Had to wait for a long time once with a big group even though we had made a reservation and the hostess felt bad and bought all our drinks for us and 5 appetizers to share!  Everything on the menu is great and inventive.","1476":"Misty is one of the area's best craft bartenders, no doubt. Beyond that all-important detail? Despite liking and missing the previous incarnation, I really like this new Green Street. The atmosphere is comfortable and upscale at the same time, and you get a sense of cohesiveness and camaraderie from the staff. The menu's short and sweet and rarely disappointing. And the brownie sundae? Goes quite well with a Toronto. Mmm.","1477":"The hotel is very conveniently located close to the airport and local venues. Nice option is to leave the car there for a small fee if you fly out. The reason for 3 stars is the shuttle driver's rudeness. When I was picked up from the airport, he drove around to come back to the same gate and when I asked about it he scoffed me off","1478":"Best food! Cheap, quick, local!!! Natick has a jem! You never see great places like this anymore a true classic. Everything is so high tech and cloned these days....not casey's this place is one of a kind.","1479":"Way to overpriced for a goodwill, i like a good bargain!  However they did have nice stuff!","1480":"The ABSOLUTE worst!!! I've never had a rental company ask for insurance cards but what's worst is that even when you come with your insurance cards they ask for your insurance summary to prove your coverages! The inspection stickers on the car was expired. They said if you get a ticket mail it to them and they will pay it..... yeah right! Ask for a refund and they give you a 1800 number in which they may or may not give you a refund!!!!  The customer service is non-existent The worst rental car company EVER!! If your thinking about using them.....DONT!!!","1481":"Don't expect anything fancy.  You will smell like the grill, drink out of a can, and maybe even use paper plates.  But who cares!  The food is great and is prepared by super friendly owner.  It is a small time operation, so like the other review noted, finding her open may be a challenge.  Just call ahead, or if you are in Oregon City, (the real OC) you will smell the sweet smoke of yummy.","1482":"Was in town so a local friend and I went in 3\/2 Friday night around 730. It was busy so hostess suggested seats at the bar.  Drinks came pretty quickly, but ordering took a while for a waiter to come back.  The food came aok, but then things went downhill.  It took forever to get a check as we couldn't get any of the bartenders' attention (and my friend had to get home to her child)  We finally got a check and it was 120 - umm, not our check. So then we had to wait to try to get someone's attention. Then we got our check.  But no one coming back to take payment. I finally got up, walked to the other side of the  bar, and got a bartender's attention to take my payment. I explained all these delays and he apologized and said he would review with staff (we told hostess too), but no offer of comping bill, or credit for future or anything and now the parking cost more in the lot because it took forever to get out of there - I think it was after 10p at this point!  My friend and I were exhausted and annoyed.  If you are going to seat people at the bar, you need to have normal service, and bring the right check, and collect payment so people can get out.  And then when we tell you it's a disaster, you should try to make good in some fashion.  Sorry really isn't enough when you've ruined our evening.  Getting more and more disappointed in this chain.","1483":"I came here with a friend and his godparents, who are very fond of this place.  The decor is sleek with dark wood and white table linens.  The noise level is deafening which I found challenging since the godparents were get along in their years.  The portions were small but the food was excellent.  I had the Boston Bibb Salad with Grilled Marinated Shrimp, Lemongrass, Tangerines, Almonds, Creamy Lime Vinaigrette.  I didn't think it was very remarkable but still, quite tasty.  As an entree I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with Baby Bok Choy, Finnan Haddie Sauce and I think the spinach.  It lacked flavor and had no real kick but maybe that's because I'm into ethnic, exotic foods.  The wine was delicious.  The only thing I really remember is the dessert which was a creme brulee.  It's really difficult to mess that up.  It was perfection.  The top was so crisp with a very satisfying crack when my spoon dug in.","1484":"The management is super rude. The manager acts like it is your privilege to be eating his food and any changes to the menu are beneath his kingdom. He also treats DoorDash customers very very poorly and is rude to the delivery person. All three doordash orders I've made from here came with a major error to the order. The food is good if you can get them to actually give you what you ordered.","1485":"This is a dichotomized review.\nThere's the food (4 stars), and the service (1 star). \nThe food was fine. It was good - nothing special, that is, it's the stuff you find at many other places (burgers, fries, etc.). This was good and for that I'd consider this place again. Then comes the service. The orders for the table were incorrectly brought out: from the drinks, to the food, to finally the bill. The wrong beer was brought out - they apologized but instead of only bringing out the correct order, they brought out the correct order and charged for their mistake. The food was fine, and the drink refills were fine. Then when the bill came, we were all charged for a portion of 3 beers, even though their mistake included 2 beers. After bringing it up, they gave us grief and took over 20 minutes to try to fix it. it was so awful considering two of those beers two people offered to pay for and the other one no one knows why they added it to the bill. For service, I'm not coming back - for food...meh, only if other places are full.","1486":"Although their space may be small (6 stools inside and two patio tables outside), their coffee is definitely big. Any coffee shop serving exclusively Roseline coffee knows what they're doing. From their basic drip to their carefully crafted specialty coffee drinks, Never hits the mark every time.","1487":"I like clarklewis. I have specific reasons why, so I will add them here.\n\nHappy hour:\n\nThis is when I go. I have never been for lunch or dinner, though lunch I might do. The spaghetti with pesto was so perfect. It was a marriage of summer, butter, and cheese in my mouth.\n\nI followed that with a ham and fontina sandwich, mostly because I was at clarklewis and their cooking technique never disappoints me. So, yes. I got a perfectly toasted sandwich that was not overwhelmed by any element and included a hot, grainy mustard.\n\nLast was the ice cream cup, an amazing vanilla flavor drizzled with raspberry puree. It was nestled in the thinnest crepe of a cup, also tasty.\n\nBonus: a gin and lime gimlet made with syrup. It was so good I had two.","1488":"What a relief to have a great meal in an airport. The Salmon hot pot was excellent. Can't wait to return!","1489":"I echo many of the previous reviews.  First, be very careful to review the \"professional design\" they put together for you.  We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.\n\nSecond, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. \n\nYou are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.  We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.","1490":"I have been here twice: once for a la cart and once for AYCE.  Both times, I found good value.  For the a la cart, I had a teriyaki dish, and they made adjustments to my taste with no issue.  The food was well done, and there was a lot for the price! \n\nWhen I returned for AYCE, I felt there was a really good selection.  The food tasted good, and the service was good.  I would definitely go bad.  To top it off, it accepts Lyoness, so I got cash back with my meal! Bonus!","1491":"We came in on a Friday in the early afternoon. It was very busy but we were surprised to be seated immediately. The service is decent, the waitresses are friendly but don't pay much attention to the customers. But what they lack in service they make up in flavor! I ordered a 2 egg Benedict on regular English muffin with mushroom and white cheddar cheese and split with my friend who ordered hers with ham and the hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were a tad over poached for my liking; the yolk was barely runny. But as a whole the dish worked perfectly. The muffin was toasted to crunchy perfection and the mushrooms provided a lovely bed for the egg, topped with sharp white cheddar. But, by far the best dish we ordered was the lemon truffle hash! The truffle oil flavored the potatoes magically with just a hint of the lemon. \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for a nice brunch. Try to go during an off hour or weekday to avoid a crowd.","1492":"Nice day spa with a variety of options and from my experience a lack of a hard sell on any products.  Very pleasant people who work there and they provide great service (bonus - they said I have great skin!).","1493":"This place is great! The service is amazing. I was able to meet the chef who made the best Jerk Chicken wrap with mango salsa....BOMB!! I bought one for my husband (to go)...he loved it as well. They also have tasty cupcakes. Try the pumpkin cupcake...so goooood. Seriously. Im glad I found this gem.","1494":"So happy to update my last review for Steel... I was contacted by Chuck, the owner of Steel, after seeing my comments following a visit with a college pal. (You might peruse that previous review first for context.)\n\nWe had a lengthy phone conversation, specifically about White Tuna - which is an endangered species and, as you'll read in my previous review, was an offending dish during our visit. Chuck invited me back for an on-the-house meal, and I got to spend time with an incredibly dedicated restaurant owner who is committed to this city and excellence in foodieism. (On the day I visited, he had accepted the award from Creative Loafing for the city's best sushi.)\n\nThe Lobster Roll, which is one I had during my return visit, is a must. We had a smattering of other tasty nibbles, including the spicy tuna (great) - but the lobster roll was most certainly the stand-out.\n\nChuck also connected me with a source in New Orleans to interview for a blog post. So, not only was I re-enchanted with a local restaurant I had previously loved - I made a new friend in the process. Support this joint, because Steel opened and survived during the 2008 downturn and is still one of the nicest eating environments in midtown.","1495":"Check your receipt very carefully if you shop here. Things are often rung up differently (usually more) than they are priced.\n\nProduce is not very fresh. Why is the quality at this store so inferior to other Star Markets? I'd rather drive a mile and a half further to the one on route 9 just to get produce that isn't rotten by the time you get home.","1496":"This is an alright italian resturant. The garlic bread is a big roll soaked in oil and comes with pasta. I got baked ziti, which was penne with chese melted on top. Serving sizes were on the snaller side and the pasta was bland. Probably wouldn't come back to this restaurant.","1497":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner. We recently moved to Austin from California and found this place highly regarded by his co-workers. First of all, we went on a Tuesday- so there was NO wait which was fantastic. Our server's name was Bailey, I believe, and he was really attentive. The atmosphere of this cute little restaurant is in itself, enjoyable. I had the bacon-wrapped filet special with asparagus and roasted red potatoes. I LOVED the portion size; I'm pretty small and I always struggle finishing the food on my plate. It was such a phenomenal meal. And, to top it off, the Manager came over to our table and talked to us and once he found out is was our anniversary, he gave us a FREE creme brulee dessert. We had such an awesome time here, the service is quick, the employees are polite and friendly, and the food is amazing. I reccomend this place to anyone who wants a great dining experience. Customer service was exceptional, well done.","1498":"I had the pot roast and my partner had the hot turkey plate which was pretty awesome! The only complaint food wise would be that my daughters bacon was pretty well done, but that seemed to be all the bacon that I saw here.\n\nFood came out pretty quick!\n\nOur waiter Joyce was amazing and definitely made us and our daughter feel welcomed! LOVED her! \n\nFor some reason they allowed a dog inside which his owner tied to the bottom of his chair. During our meal he barked a few times at the family across the way from him.  I'm not really fond of animals inside my food establishments.. The begging, the barking and the shaking which causes dog hair to fly around is the reason why. \n\nOverall I probably would've given 4 stars if it wasn't for the fact of the dog inside the restaurant so close to my table and our food.","1499":"There was a huge pile of puke outside their store that no one cleaned up, a homeless man begging for money right behind the puke, another homeless man using their phone at the photo center for over ten minutes, and the quality of my photos were so bad I had to return them. The current manager on site did not apologize for the poor quality and seemed to care less for that matter.","1500":"My boyfriend and I live about a mile away from the mad italian. It's a curse and a blessing because of how often we go. We always start off with the wings, usually getting half lemon pepper (my favorite) and half sweet and sour. Seriously, the best wings around here. The lemon pepper is always so super crispy with a good amount and seasoning and the sweet and spicy are just spicy enough. The philly's here are ahhhmaazing. But so is EVERYTHING. We've have gotten everything from alfredo to salads and everything is fresh, and super delicious.","1501":"Best yellow curry I've tasted.  I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine, but I've been going to Titaya's for years.  Now that they have re-opened after their re-model, the place is definitely nicer on the inside as well.  Great food.","1502":"I'd heard great things about Sanborn's... that it could possibly be the best breakfast in Portland. It was very good, we'll be back, but there were small details that robbed this place of 5 stars. If they had half stars, I would have given this a 4.5 stars. First the good: The eggs were cooked perfectly, almost too perfectly. The bacon was absolutely 5 stars out of 5. The service was another 5 stars, absolutely great. The 4 homemade jams they served to us were out of this world. Coffee, very good. My husband got the biscuits, which were very good, maybe a little on the dense side, but good none-the-less. His corned beef hash and poached eggs, most excellent. My only complaints were the starches. The potatoes were a little soggy and greasy and the toast was stale. All in all, a great place for breakfast.","1503":"WIll not be going here ever again.  Went out with friends for dinner here and were super excited to try it out.  We put our names in and were told it would be about 20 minutes.  After waiting for about 40 minutes we asked the host what was going on?  He explained to us people were not leaving etc.....he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for a table of 4. The service was so so poor.  Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert.  We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever.  We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once.  The food was sub-par to say the least.  The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar.  After we finished dinner we decided we would just order 2 desserts to spit between both couples.  When we ordered the two $6.00 desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free!  Needless to say, horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff, the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our $12.00 worth of dessert that they had reminded is 4 time that we would be getting. Very upsetting and disappointing night.","1504":"Decor is kitschy but clean and layout is nice. Staff are friendly and prompt. \n\nTheir tacos try a bit too hard to be creative, I feel. Stick with the classics and do them well unless you have a really unique combo. Tortillas for my tacos were limp and greasy. This def ain't California!","1505":"Coffee and sandwich place. I had a turkey sandwich, which was pretty good. Went to over a Latte after lunch at 2:52pm (they close at 3pm) and they told me no, because they already cleaned the machine :\/ one star for poor customer service.","1506":"Wonderful meal and atmosphere.  The outside is so different from what we discovered inside. The prices were unbelievable.  Had a carnitas wet burrito and there must have been half pound of meat that was well seasoned.  The guacamole was fresh and delish. What a hidden treasure!","1507":"So happy that Yelp brought me to this treasure since it was nothing short to what we were hoping for. Quality, local, affordable, authentic. We ordered our food to-go so I cannot comment on the whole experience of Sofrito but what I can tell you is that the food is outstanding, the prices are way more than reasonable and in Orlando? Is that even possible? \n\nYou order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. \n\nAnd as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.\n\nI'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts. If you go to Orlando and don't stop at Sofrito, all I can say is that you will miss out.","1508":"Grimy - seedy - unappetizing in every possible manner.\n\nThis past Saturday, 80s dance night consisted of the overwhelming stench of human body odor, a sorry absence of fun hair metal rock, and an overabundance of emo new wave - dislike.\n\nThat, and a 7$ cover to experience the high school Rocky Horror brand of alternative, replete with many persons in possession of ripped clothing and crazy eyes.\n\nMy heart swept to the nearby ZuZu and Middle East. Next time.","1509":"First of I'm very very disappointed.... this place is suppose to be Italian and they are far far from that. The pizza taste like old old cheese that was left out. I ordered a steak tip salad which I order a lot of from different places and this one is the worst by far, first of the tips where frozen cold which is disgusting. Second I got cooked peppers in a salad with no cucumbers, I went home and added cucumbers .... then the Italian Calzone had nothing but cheese inside, and it tasted horrible. The French fries and the fried chicken tasted like a fried Egg.... Hi hello clean the oil it's old. It was a waste of my money and if I could give it no stars I would.\n\nLastly they wanted to over charge me and when I questioned it I got an attitude for it... we walked into all burning smoke air and it took another 10mins to get my order that they told me would be ready in 20mins. Kind you it took me 30mins to get there, I would never ever recommend this place to anyone.....\n\nit's disgusting","1510":"Horrible experience, the car was late picking us up(1 hour late). The driver did not help with baggage. We waited an additional 2 hours when arriving to the service at 1:30am just to pick up our car. They are extremely understaffed, not the worker's fault, but there was only one guy on staff. He had to do 3 people's job: rent out cars, pick up cars from airport parking and even drive the cars back. So ridiculous! Would never use them again.","1511":"I was so happy to hear about this place after my new iPhone took a nose dive off the hood of my boyfriend's truck.  The screen was shattered and I actually considered filing an insurance claim (through AT&T iPhone insurance) to get a new phone.  I ended up taking my phone here and for half the price of what my deductible would have been for a new phone, they replaced the glass screen for me and helped me pick out an Otter Box since I obviously am a little clumsy with my phone.  The guy at the front was very polite and helpful and got my repairs done in about an hour!  I hope I don't need to use them again, but if my poor phone has another accident I will be sure and bring it here!","1512":"I LOVE this place. I usually find parking around Allston pretty easily on the streets or in the lot behind the liquor store. It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line.\n\nTheir portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. \n\nTheir bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. \n\nTheir pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.\n\nThe shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.\n\nI generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing. I just really enjoy how consistent, simple, and good it always is.","1513":"Tonight, we had the most pleasant meal I've ever had. Good pizza. Great Bowie. Queen. The Cure. Great drink selection.  We ate the brattle. Highly recommended from us. Tonight was a quiet, cold Thursday night, and we loved the low key ambiance. People seemed to be loving the soup. Great for a cold winter evening. The guys were pretty funky and cool, too. Bit of advice: follow the vibe. If it's quiet, be easy. If it's lively, go with it. And be happy!","1514":"I booked my hair appointment here with Annelise last weekend, where I chopped off my long hair for a bob. Annelise is an easygoing girl and I found it easy to talk to her throughout my time in the chair. \n\nShe showed great attention to detail during the cut and was diligent in explaining what she was doing and the products she was using. At no point in time did she ever try to push a product too hard on me which I appreciated. I did end up getting this amazing smelling sea salt hair spray though! \n\nI would return for future cuts, and am considering doing a balayage\/ombre session with her.","1515":"My sister has gone to Smiles on Sandy for at least thirty years and referred me to Dr. Daby for a consultation on possibly a full set of upper dentures. Every dentist that I have gone too has treated me in a sub-human way because, unfortunately I was not blessed with the greatest of teeth, and was treated as if I didn't care about them so they didn't care what they did to them. \nThis is THE place to go to be treated with kindness, compassion, non- judgment and complete professionalism. \nDr. Daby did not do what every other Dentist has done to me like just saying \"your teeth and gums are beyond repair so when you are ready I'll pull them all out for you when you get dentures.\" Instead, he did a through exam and found teeth that could stay and recommended a partial. \nAll the preparation before getting the actual partial was completely painless and all of his staff were so kind and considerate. Not \"condescendingly kind,\" but \"truly\" kind. \nWhen the day came for the actual \"pulling\" of my teeth (I only lost six!) I was very nervous and anxious. My sister came with me to hold my hand and support me through it and it went very well, after it was all finished and I saw myself in the mirror it made me cry. All of my worst fears were for not and I am SO happy with the results. \nThank you Dr. Daby and all the staff at Smiles on Sandy I am grinning from ear to ear again!","1516":"I was in Decatur and wanted Pizza. I go to Mellow Mushroom all the time but wanted something different and thought of Mojos- having been once last year.\n\nI remembered this as pretty good pizza, much better than Fellinis, so I visited again.\n\nI ordered a couple of slices, each with a topping.  Because I don't really like cheese that well I asked for a little extra sauce on top to cover it up.  I routinely do this at all pizza joints.\n\nAfter finishing the slices, that were really large, I received the bill and noticed that I had been charged an additional 50 cents per slice for the sauce. There wasn't that much sauce there, even with the extra sauce.  This, on top of the other charges for the toppings I ordered.\n\nThe bill came to 10.97 plus tip for 2 slices and a glass of tea.   I complained about the sauce charge and the waitress, a really cute young lady, apologized and said that it was what the button added automatically.\n\nWell, Mojo, you need to reprogram your button or just handle the sauce by spoken word instead of punching that button.  These are the little things that cause me not to return to a place. This is the only time I have ever been charged for this- anywhere!","1517":"I called to get a broken cable on my garage door fixed. They were pleasant on the phone and came out quickly, but I was surprised that they charge a \"standard\" $146 just to come out (even if under an hour). I wish they were more up front about that it seems like a ridiculous charge for something that took less than an hour. They were at my house no more than 15-20 minutes to fix the cable and I live nearby Burlington.","1518":"The food is amazing, the cookies are fantastic. I'd give full stars but every time I go there (mainly for cookies for either work or home, I work in the mall) the customer service is terrible. They are short and very rude. The last time I went I asked why kind of tomato soup the soup was, and got an \"I don't know. It's soup with tomato and cheese\" that was it. Nothing else. I went ahead a got it but she didn't take a second to ask any of the other employees. I've also witnessed them talk to one another about a customer who was still in front of them saying \"ugh I can tell today is going to be a long day\". I would recommend this place for the food but the service, is terrible. And I'd say that as well.","1519":"One of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. The poutine with mushroom miso gravy is out of this world. And the IPA and chocolate stouts my party ordered were both delicious.","1520":"Treated my little pup perfectly.  Excellent service both in person and on the phone.  I'll be back with Bruschi!!","1521":"An open letter to TCV:\nRecently I missed an appointment. I understood the policy of charging a fee for a missed appointment and completely accept that as fair and reasonable. However I received a letter in the mail today regarding my missed appointment that was completely offensive and unprofessional. The letter stated that if I missed 3 appointments in a 12 month rolling period \"for reasons that we do not find acceptable\" I will no longer be permitted to receive care from any TCV location. I'm going to tell a couple things: It is not MY privilege to be your customer, it is your privilege to have ME as a customer. Your customers can choose to be with a company that values their business, you however can not exist without customers. Secondly, who are you to determine what is an acceptable reason for missing an appointment? Have you elected a \"Missed appointenet czar\" who will determine my fate based on their arbitrary judgement? Why I missed an appointment in frankly none of your business. I and I alone will determine whether I have something more important or not. Your arrogance in this statement only highlights your obtuse regard for customer service. \nAt this point, I will most likely search for a new privider whom I believe values me as customer. Considering that you view my business as a annoying obligation, you probably won't care much about my departure. But maybe you will realize that you have lost site of the basics of growing a business which is that every customer should feel appreciated and serviced with respect, and you will redirect your policies to reflect those values.","1522":"Would have given La Taq 5 stars after it first opened. We had great service, food and drinks. But the last few times we've been the service has been awful and the bartender (with the Australian accent) only looks your way if you're one of the beautiful people. Really disappointing! Not going back, at least until the service is better.","1523":"Wake up and smell the coffee! SF coffee is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop! I love how walkable\/ bikeable this place is to my house. I usually stop here on my way to work grabbing my usual Iced Latte with a 7-grain bagel or a bacon egg cheese bagel sandwich. \n\nThis is seriously some of the best coffee that you'll find in the Highlands. You'll get freshly roasted coffee from Peru, Antigua and many other international special blends. All of their food is made to order, made with local ingredients and made in house. The egg and cheese bagel with bacon, ham and cheese croissant, blueberry cream muffin are among my favorite eats.\n\nThe shop is very quaint and cozy. There is a usually a great mix of people working on their computers, people catching up with old friends, and impersonal business meetings. It's definitely quiet enough in there to get work done or study, if needed.\n\nEveryone that works here is super friendly, including Leo, Caitlin and Mariana, who are always so full of great energy and optimism in the mornings. I never feel rushed to order (I'm super indecisive) or made to feel like an inconvenience. It gets pretty crowded in here during the mornings, which is typical for a coffee shop, so get there early if you're on a time crunch.","1524":"This place was a pleasant surprise. First I didn't realize that there was a Marketplace on Krog street. If you're in the area it's worth giving it a try. There are lots of food and other specialty shops! I stopped here because the food looked delicious!  You can watch them prepare it, and once I dug into my laffa I realize this was a good choice. The ingredients were fresh, and the laffa was very filling. I tried the Salatim, which was full of vegetables. I also added beef. The portions were generous, but I ended up paying about 6 extra dollars for the meat for a total of $16. I will definitely come back and try other dishes.","1525":"Simply put - Blake is amazing!  He is super busy but always manages to squeeze me in.  I run my own business so its difficult to take the time out of my day to get my hair done.  Blake has actually stopped by my store to remind me when I need to get a cut.  Not only is he considerate about my scheduling needs but he's fantastic at washing\/cutting\/styling my hair.  I just had him do my hair the day of an event and I got so many compliments all night long and they continued throughout the weekend.  I'm so happy I found him - I highly recommend!","1526":"This is the third hospital my father was transferred to after he fell very ill almost two weeks ago.  The best one by far.  My mom, my brother, or I have been staying in the room 24 hours a day, got to see many nurses, doctors, assistants, housekeeping staff, meal delivery people.  Every single person is polite, friendly, caring.  Not only do they act unhurried, willing to take their time and answer questions, gentle and patient with my dad, while constantly apologizing to him for disturbing him even as he sleeps through most of the visits, we, the family members, are asked if there is anything that we need by almost every person who walks into the room.  Our requests are met with nods and smiles.  Our 7th floor room is clean, large, with a huge window that offers us a view of Downtown and the Capitol, plus great sunsets.  In my sleep-deprived state I find myself routinely referring to it as a hotel rather than hospital room.  Food is surprisingly decent, some offerings I've tried were restaurant quality, for sure.  Even the security guards were pleasant and polite when I left the building after hours and realized I had to go through metal detectors and bag search on my way back into the building.  Considering very trying circumstances that brought us to this hospital, we feel like everyone had tried to make sure we were as comfortable as possible the week we had spent there so far.","1527":"Holy Cow! This place got a major facelift recently and it is sooooo much better! The food, the atmosphere, the staff and management, I enjoyed it all so much on my first time coming back to Anna Bannanas after a hiatus. \n\nYou gotta try Robin's Tomato Basil soup. It is LITERALLY the best tomato soup I've had ever! They add chunks of avocado to it for a really special extra touch. It really is so tasty! Jamie, the barista, is very helpful, patient and super friendly! I felt right at home, especially once I had the Tomato Basil soup on a rainy day. I've read other reviews about their less than cared for atmosphere, but with the new management in charge, it's super comfortable and a lot cleaner than the past years. \n\nThis place will definitely be one of my regular neighborhood spots, especially if the soup is on the menu for the day! Can't wait to see what the new management has in store for Anna Bannanas for the future!","1528":"The good: the service was great and the line wasn't too long when I went on a Monday evening!\n\nThe bad: My order came with an incredible amount of cream-based sauce that was just too heavy for my liking. As a Mediterranean restaurant, I would have appreciated there to be more acidity to cut through the heaviness.","1529":"This hotel is my normal first choice for the location near family I am visiting, but this time I had room overlooking the pool.  It is very noisy with unsupervised children yelling well past 11pm, in violation of the hotel's own policy.  Most we're under 14 years of age, again contrary to stated hotel policy.  If you want quiet, avoid the pool side rooms.","1530":"Nice place inside beer is good got some good waitresses, food is like so so but the waitress i had, i believe her name was Cristina very pretty, nice smile and very nice. Great memory when it comes to wht i ordered so didn't have to repeat my self for round 2. Bowling and pool tables on the pricy side but not bad. Management has really sunk this place compared to what it used to be. Always running out of stuff ,so have to always check to see what they do have. As long as they have good waitresses like cristina ill always come back.","1531":"Its hard not to admit that the sandwiches here are really good.  Each inspired by a popular restaurant around boston, the sanwiches at Parish are pretty delicious and original.  The drinks are pretty yummy as well (also strong).  BUT the prices are pretty high.  Try it out once at least, but there are other good sandwich places for much more reasonable prices.","1532":"This is my all time favorite place to eat , ever!  Everything is Vegan,  and so wonderfully delicious.  The Pho is my fave and I have to order it every time I go there.  The vegetable and spring rolls are awesome as well. It is ran by Buddhist Nuns who are just wonderful.  The language barrier proves to be comical at times.  Can't overstate how wonderful this place is","1533":"Swank has been one our most favorite restaurants in downtown and we've never had a bad meal. Except this last one, and it doesn't appear to have been an \"off\" night.  Swank has a new chef that kept the menu basically the same but the preparation was far from what we had anticipated and was very disappointing.  All of our favorites, including the tartar, the 1\/2 chicken, pork chop and duck, were more than lacking under this new chef (the duck was inedible even after a second try). It is upsetting because what \"was\" was perfect.  Now, not so much, which saddens me greatly.  I think we'll stick with the bar Swine as their menu has not been changed.  BTW: the service on this disappointing night was amazing as always.","1534":"Loved this place! I was in Colorado on vacation from Chicago and my friend found this place online. There was a bit of a wait, but it was soooo worth it. I had the Cajun omelette and it was awesome. The potatoes were perfect. The biscuits were some of the best I ever had. I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Colorado.","1535":"I came here the very first night I moved to the east coast.  Everything was so new to me..   I remember thinking to myself -- what is this hip place.. they're swanksters sitting on long platforms that are elevated and carpety.   look at those comfy pillows all over the place.  everyone looks sorta chill while they casually glance at that psychadelic wizard of oz type shit on a projection screen --  It's true.. I'm usually thinking in lowercase and I was also really digging this place.  Then someone kicked me because I was blocking his view of the trippy shit on the wall.  I gave him the best west coast mellow out glance I had but he was impervious.   My culture shock was reborn and my first impression was mostly lost.  \r\nI live close to this place and notice it just gets trendier every time I go back.  It still has that perfect little place with a lounge like atmosphere that breaks into dance parties once in a while vibe(+5) but I have come to feel like hipsters and prepsters, when combined (-2), overshadow most of the perks.","1536":"I just also wanted to comment on Thao--she does a GREAT JOB with both cut and color.  When I first went to her, I had gotten a really unflattering haircut from another salon in the neighborhood and she was able to really improve it, not to mention give me some great highlights.  Later that day I got a lot of compliments on my hair (since it looked so much better than it did before with the previous haircut).  I've been going to Thao since!  I highly recommend her.  Plus she's very upbeat and a hoot to talk to.","1537":"Customer service: they rush you to make decisions on food. Staff pressured us to order dimsum item we didn't want. Later found out it's left over food which they wanted to get rid of.\nFood: quality is poor. Whether rice or noodles, bland, little meats or veggies in them. Not fresh ingredients.\nPrice: overpriced for the lack of quality.\nDo not recommend.","1538":"I went here for A casual drink and convo! Listen..the mojitos are pretty good with the cane sugar stick in it.","1539":"This is only a comment on their vegetarian fare. Good starter (battered and fried vegetables) and nice simple kale salad but their vegetarian risotto was no risotto. It was more if a tasty rice dish served inside a overcooked and mushy bell pepper. The dish did not have a creamy, brothy quality. I suspect it wasn't even arborio rice. Very disappointing. Just serve a \"rice\" dish but don't call it \"risotto\".","1540":"Won't be coming back here. I usually disregard reviews that only talk about service and not food but now I get it. The service here ruined our meal. We came in for happy hour -food and drinks took forever and our server only seemed nice when she brought the check. If this place had stellar food it would offset the bad service but unfortunately it doesn't. Food was decent but nothing to brag about. Some of our oysters were literally the size of a quarter and I'm talking about the shell.","1541":"Good happy hour, and good fish and pork tacos. They are a little pricey if you don't hit happy hour, but still, it's good food. Service has never been bad. I'll go maybe twice a year.","1542":"Decided to head over to Chen's after we walked into Asia cafe and the place was packed.\n\nI ordered the Curry Rib soup and it was awesome! Spicy but not too spicy, had some excellent bok-choy and tomatoes. The rib meat was so tender and the noodles were nice and chewy.\n\nWe also had the steamed dumplings which were excellent as well. Nice dough and tasty insides.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try it again. They were out of the combination soup which was my first choice.","1543":"I hired Kelley Tree Services to remove an enormous Maple Tree from my back yard. Their outstanding professionalism and expertise resulted in a safe and effective removal of an unhealthy tree from a very tight space using their crane. I would highly recommend using Kelley Tree Services and feel extremely comfortable recommending them to friends and family.","1544":"Small but not busy in morning. Staff do say hi and bye which is better than most of their gyms.  Equipment needs to fixed better. They have only 2 bikes and one doesn't work. Overall not bad because so slow. When I go anyways.","1545":"This was our first stop on our Austin trip, and I thought it was a cool place. We decided to stop in for brunch on a Saturday because it looked like our kind of spot and because it didn't seem too busy. Overall, the food was good, the drinks we very good, and the service was just OK. \n\nI'm a big fan of a good bloody mary, so I decided to go with the $4 bloody mary special they were having. Great drink. It tasted very fresh and like they spiced it themselves (rather than using some kind of purchased mix). You could see the fresh black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (which added a nice heat) floating in the drink. This was probably my favorite part of the experience. \n\nMy wife got the local beer flight, but they were out of a couple of beers, so they substituted others that were not local. No prob here: all of the beers were good. They have a decent selection of beers to choose from, too. \n\nFor my meal, I got the cobb salad, which was good. It was a nicely dressed salad topped with grilled chicken, fresh avocado, hardboiled egg, bacon, and feta cheese. I enjoyed it. My wife got the tacos, which she liked. \n\nAll in all, I would have gone with 4*, but the service was a little rough. Our waitress unexpectedly changed in the middle of our service (no one told us; a new person just started coming over to ask if we needed anything), and it was difficult to get the check at the end of the meal. I asked our new server, who forgot, and then I asked the hostess, who had to go ask our server again. Not a disaster, but not really smooth either. \n\nI would definitely give the Ale House another try if I came back to Austin.","1546":"I went to the Weymouth location yesterday using a Groupon deal.  Beautiful salon, great staff, and my Stylist, Meredith, was fabulous\n\nDefinitely would recommend!","1547":"Best burritos around town! Excellent customer service... try to eat here whenever I am in town.","1548":"My opinion on this restaurant a little while back was definitely swayed by the service but I have to say that after coming back today, it was definitely better. My server Vanessa was on it and attentive. The menu has changed but she definitely knows her stuff. I would recommend the restaurant and definitely the service.","1549":"Ph\u0413\u0456 is something I purchase regularly from this place, and after trying a few places around town, this place has the best I've tasted in Vancouver. Friendly and fast service to help with my lunch break stop and go!","1550":"My experience with Thierry Chocolaterie Patisserie Cafe was luxury.  I had this feeling when I go into Holt Renfew shopping lol.  I would go back in a beat.  The exotic desserts are exceptional.  Every bite is a goodness like spoiling yourself with no excuses need it.  Allowing yourself to indulge the richness through your taste bugs from a tiny bite of the dark chocolate and a sip of cappuccino with no sugar.. ahh heaven... there you are..","1551":"I've been coming to BURN for almost a year, ever since I've been on ClassPass. What I like most about it are the challenging workouts (they fly by) and the two passionate instructors whose classes I've had the pleasure of attending: Jonathon (the owner) and Joseph.\n\nI've joined Jonathon for Circuit Row and Joseph for Tabata when they were still doing 630pm classes on Thursdays. I think both classes are awesome! A bit nervous to try any other of the plethora they offer, but based on the 2 for 2 track record so far, I'm remiss to not try any others.\n\nThe classes are good for all levels since you can easily go at your own pace, but both Jonathon & Joseph will challenge you to work past your comfort level in a really positive demeanor. Jonathon's go to line: \"You're done when I say you're done, not when you're tired.\"\n\nThe only set backs: the studio is a bit small (but they somehow always make the space work even with completely full classes) and they only offering personal training at 6am, so for full time city workers, there's no option for an AM workout - the earliest group class offered is 7am.","1552":"I've been to this location a couple of times, the service has never been great but I've come back for the good food. This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.","1553":"I can't tell you how disappointed we were in a late brunch here.  After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  \n\nIt started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.\n\nWhen our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, \"oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.\"   I said, \"well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?\"  She said, \"I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?\"  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?\n\nWe ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato souffl\u0413\u00a9 (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. \n\nWhen the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, \"everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, \"No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?\" Her response was, \"It's a sweet potato souffl\u0413\u00a9, I can get you whipped cream.\"  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.\n\nThe food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience I'm willing to tell my friends about. \n\nThis unfortunately, will not be a place I would recommend.","1554":"This dark, non-smoking bar, is tucked away from the stuff on 28th. I enjoyed it enough, kinda typical NYC or SF urban style. The music wasn't constant and there were dead silences (weird) but on the plus side they were playing Team America which is super funny. A few friends came in with a bottle of wine that we were going to imbibe at home and the bartender told us to take it out of the bar or cork it. Random, rude and uncalled for.","1555":"Bob (the manager) and Justin are fantastic.  They really know their stuff, there's no hard sell, they're honest and direct and the prices are so reasonable.  I originally went in with a bike I'd had for 5 years (from Craigslist!) and never really maintained.  I knew it was in rough shape and had an idea what might be wrong, but Justin looked it over thoroughly then and there was really honest about how much work\/money was needed to make it safe and rideable again - key for me as I'm 4 1\/2 months pregnant and bike commute to my downtown job.  When I got another bike, I brought it there right away for a tuneup and again, they did a fantastic job.  A few weeks later, I started having trouble with it - gears wouldn't change, chain seemed to be skipping, tension on the chain was getting much higher - and when it finally seized on me right in the middle of the Main\/Union intersection at 7.30am, I wheeled it back to the store and knocked the door.  Bob was there early and with no hesitation, let me in and had it up on the stand right away.  He called me before 10am with the prognosis and I was able to pick up my bike and cycle home that night.  Not only did he replace the faulty part with a part that will likely last the lifetime of the bike, but he also looked the bike over for free, even checking a wheel that he replaced for me the previous time.    They are just AWESOME.  Love love love you guys - if you have a bike, this is where you need to go.  Great prices, service is outstanding and they really know their stuff.  This is a no BS bike shop fo sho.","1556":"This store is FANTASTIC. The owners are super knowledgeable and are great with making suggestions. You can actually rent games to try them out (considering how expensive games are these days this is a brilliant idea) $5 for a 3-day rental and if you decide to purchase you get the $5 credit towards your game. We have enjoyed everything we have tried so far. Not just games, but puzzles too. There is a whole room with tables set up for play and multiple groups that meet geared towards specific games. I have found that their prices aren't marked up too much from what you could get at a big box store and I would rather give my money to these wonderful locals. They participate with Supportland so rack up your points!","1557":"I went with my boyfriend and we got the saag paneer and the cholley with an order of naan. Both were very flavorful and delicious. The staff was also extremely courteous and attentive. A great experience overall!","1558":"Out of all the sushi places I've been to, I have to say they consistently had fresh fish each and every single time I've been here. The prices are fair for the amount and freshness of the fish. I find myself craving the soft and sweet salmon all the time!","1559":"This place is a favorite of mine for breakfast, esp the oyster omelette. It had been 6 years since I last visited and still delicious and just as I remembered.","1560":"Well, I eat here about 3 or 4 times a week, that must say it all! haha...I love the wrap, for it's food, for it's convenience, for the quick service. I love it all.  I'm a big fan of the buffalo chicken wrap, the bangkok, and the teriyaki. I also love getting the house salad in a wrap with feta cheese. So good. Yes, you can get any salad in a wrap for an easy on the go meal. \n\nI do find myself still calling it the wrap, as many do, but I don't think Boloco minds. I'm sure that will eventually fade out as us loyal \"wrappers\" graduate. (I was actually thinking today how much I was gonna miss having the wrap in my backyard).  \n\nDon't forget to get the Boloco card. Many people don't know that they have a new card for the new company. You get a point for every dollar you spend and you get a free wrap once you accumulate 50 points (I think).  I use mine all the time and recently my roommate was like \"I didn't know they had that\"...and she eats there all the time too. So make sure to ask for yours!","1561":"We went for a birthday celebration and because the birthday boys girlfriend was interested in potentially working in the kitchen when she graduates from culinary school. It was all of our first time. The restaurant was a huge vast empty room at 7 o clock on a Sunday. There were 2 tables sitting outside on this beautiful Sunday evening. We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy. For the kind of money you're charging, the food better be damn good and even better service. The food was alright but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder the place was empty.","1562":"I love this venue.  A word of caution:  if you're planning on attending a show here in warm weather, you are gonna sweat your bawls off.   This venue is intimate not only with the artists, but also with your fellow audience members; you'll know soon enough who missed his Saturday bathing routine.\n\nGet here early so that you can score your seats of choice.  Be aware that some folks will come in later and get all uppity when you refuse to move.  I witnessed a couple of cutesy-wootsy college girls come in and try to giggle their way into seats together.  I explained to them that my arrival 45 minutes prior to the show was no accident, and I invited them to vacate my immediate surroundings, post-haste.  My fellow concertgoers cheered, and the lovely ladies departed, wide-eyed that someone could possibly have resisted their incredible charm, wit, and boobs.\n\nGo in cool weather, get there early, and go with a friend so that your seats can be defended while one of you runs up to one of the FULL BARS with DECENTLY PRICED drinks spread throughout the venue.","1563":"Decided to try this out on New Years with my boyfriend. We were SO DISAPPOINTED! We sat down at our table and knew we wanted to get a flight of beers. Our waitress who I found out later is the manager, says it's on the board at the bar. So we go up and try to right down our selections and they don't know where markers are. We go back to sit down and they were seating another family at our table! For the inconvenience our waitress aka manager says to get a 6 pick flight instead of 4 and she will charge us for 4 pick. This is when she says she can do that cause she's the manager. Umm okay thanks for saving me $2! We should have left I know!!! My salmon tacos were salmon mush tacos. Not a single chunk of salmon!!! My boyfriends prawns were just okay. He said the fries were gross.  We definitely went to the wrong place! I left and got a cheese pizza and beer and went home!","1564":"I go to this place twice a week as I work so close. \nI work long hours and need to get a good quality balanced meal in the middle of the day. The staff always have beaming smiles and are super polite. The food is always so fresh and healthy with fresh herbs. Love it!\nNow it might not be for everyone as you would have to like this type of food but for me it's hands down the best Thai food in Austin. You have to try the Thai Iced Tea it's superb!","1565":"We loved this place for brunch. It's a beautiful place and the food was delicious, with attentive service. We each got the fricass\u0413\u00a9e - he got the beef beef brisket and I got the mushroom fricass\u0413\u00a9e. I wasn't that hungry but I ate absolutely everything. They are both served in cast-iron frying pans so the meal stays warm as you eat it. I also got a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice and we ordered one of the waffles to go.\nThe wait for two of us on a weekday was about 45 minutes so we put our names on the list and walked around for a bit. It was well worth the wait.","1566":"They were just OK but I would not use them again or recommend them personally. We used them twice for one move. First to put some of our stuff in storage while staging our home and then for the final move a couple months later. The move went relatively smoothly but there were definitely some issues. First, they sent someone out ahead of the move so they could give us an estimate and make sure they had enough truck space. Even with that, they underestimated and there was stuff we had to put in our own vehicles and friends vehicles to transport ourselves AND we had to come all the way back to pick up even more stuff that didn't fit on the trucks. Second, we called ahead of time to discuss moving our Yamaha upright piano. They assured me they could do it, they do it ALL the time. There would be an additional charge of $200. $100 for each set of stairs. It took 4 of them over 30 mins to get it down the first set of stairs, it was so hard to watch I left the room. Then when we got to the new home, they got trapped on the first set of stairs, losing control of it and it ended up falling into the wall and putting a big dent and hole in it. We were calm and cool about it, even though this was a brand new home, and asked if THEY were all okay. Telling them, their safety and well being was our first concern, it's just a wall, etc. They were all white as ghosts and did not look confident at all about getting it up the stairs the rest of the way. We then we told them to just bring it down and move on to emptying the rest of the truck, they look relieved. We haven't even had the piano checked yet, so who knows what that adventure did to the piano. Third, when trying to navigate the treadmill to the second floor, they again got trapped at the first landing. The treadmill had to be lifted over a railing and turned but they had their shortest guy at the front and he just couldn't lift it high enough. On the last attempt, they lost control again and my husband had to help. He ended up having his end of the treadmill fall on his shoulder b\/c he was trying to stop it from hitting the head of the smaller crew member. Once the move was finally over, the damage that was done to the house during the move was written on the receipt by the crew boss and this is where our experience turned from okay to crap. When we called first thing Monday morning, we were told that we had to send a certified letter explaining the damages. We asked why would we have to send something in writing explaining it when you're looking at what your crew boss wrote on the receipt. They told us they would have their drywall guy call us, he's the best and he does this kind of repair all the time. That never happened. We called back and have emailed several times but to no avail. A lot of, \"well, let me reach out to him and have him touch base with you.\" They're great at lip service. We ultimately sent that certified letter, got a return receipt and still, it's been 8 weeks since the move and we haven't heard from anyone. So, while they can move heavy items, SOME heavy items, from point A to point B, God forbid there is a problem. They do not make solving the problem as much of a priority as getting the business.","1567":"If I could give kanes a zero I would. I purchased a 1200 dollar sofa set from them in 2011. The leather peeled off on both the sofa and the love seat. They would not fix it, they would not contact me when they said they would. They have the worst customer service and they have a recording that says your furniture is guaranteed for life. That is a lie.  I have purchased a dining set, a bedroom set and a 2000 dollar mattress from Kanes.  After the sofa set and the way they treated me I would never buy from them again.  I strongly urge you to purchase your furniture from any other company. If not you will reqret dealing with Kanes if you have a problem.","1568":"My experience in the store today was so bad that I decided it needed to be noted. I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one. I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says \"i'll be right back\". I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, \"I think we have the space blue\". (After I had looked at all of them!!!) I give up on the nail polish and say never mind. No apology or anything from her. She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude, I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay $70 for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else. I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out. I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately, but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience. I won't be going back any time soon.","1569":"I can't imagine why the rating for this place is so low.  The food and atmosphere are awesome for upscale fast food, which is basically what this place offers.\n\nI got the grilled salmon topped with piri piri mushrooms, with grilled asparagus and rice on the side.  The salmon was perfectly grilled and the portion was humongous!!  The mushrooms were a nice touch too.  I would've liked more asparagus and rice with a smaller portion of salmon, but that's just me.  Overall, I felt like I had a really healthy and satisfying meal.\n\nAlso tasted the Bonehead's shrimp (under appetizers but you can order it with rice) ... battered and fried shrimp with a delicious piri piri sauce.  It was so good!\n\nTheir sweet tea is also fantastic.   I need to book my next trip to the South to try this awesome place again!","1570":"The fifth star is usually knocked off as soon as you drive by Hopdoddy and see the line is out the door. This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain \"bros before hoes\" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?\n\nOnce you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. \nThe shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. \n\nIf you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.\n\nThe fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to \nP. TERRY's for the same quality but much cheaper.","1571":"Hit or miss on certain dishes, and definitely not where you would take someone to impress on a work lunch. I would suggest bucking up and driving out in that case.\n\nThis is definitely a suitable replace for many of us that are too lazy to leave the building for lunch. The service has always been efficient and friendly to me. There is a nice sandwich station with many options. Hot entrees and action items are alright - sometimes it just tastes a little bland. They rotate between classic meat\/starch dishes (from meat\/potatoes to noodles\/meat or rice as starch). The soup and salad station have been variably good. On Thursdays, there is sushi, spring rolls, and seaweed salad (albeit quite pricey for meh sushi). I also recommend using Levelup to pay to save time and earn some credit if you often forget lunch like me.\n\nGo here if you have to, but why on earth would you ever go out of your way for it.","1572":"I just witnessed epic customer service so I had to write a review of praise. I've always been a fan of Chick-fil-a because i think it's a great company and the food is always good. This time was no different. My chicken sandwich was hot and steamy and the waffle fries were hot with just the right amount of crispness. Here is what I witnessed that WAS different from most any other fast food chain. They were VERY busy and had four registers running with 10 people deep in each line. It took some time until I reached the front of the line to order but the team work I witnessed behind the counter was outstanding. The employees hustled about in perfect harmony, they greeted each customer with a smile, and thanked me after I was given my order. The general manager would occasionally come out from behind the counter to interact with customers and to ensure the lines were moving and guiding customers to each line. I am totally impressed! Great food and great service!","1573":"Quality of food is good but a rip off, just be beware if you order food to go, your California rolls will hardly have any crab in it. They stuffed in too much cucumber and avocado in it.  Also, the tuna rolls were not fresh. SMH.","1574":"Generally I'm not a fan of chains (hence the 3 stars instead of the 4 it would have gotten)...but anything that specializes in grilled cheese definitely has my vote!  Went for the first time last weekend with a livingsocial in hand.  It was well worth it!  I will be back for sure.  I had the Yoga Teacher (turkey, provolone, avocado, on whole grain) and it was delicious!  It was clean in there, although we did go at about 11AM...","1575":"I had an excellent  dinner.  My friends  call me a foodie ....I love to try everything.   This night I stuck to basics, crab cakes, filet and chocolate  desert. \nEvery  item was great, and I shared with friends!  \nSampled the mushroom  crepe also. \nThe service  was impeccable. ...so impeccable  that I doubled the usual gratuity , something  I  rarely  do!\n\nI also enjoyed that the  bar was outfitted  with bar chairs and standard chairs.  Another  bonus is parking us convenient  even without  using  valet.  \n\nThe view was magnificent  and comfortable  at the same time.","1576":"Stopped in here a few weeks ago knowing that I needed to get a new battery for my Civic. I went in with the hubby knowing that if I went in there myself, they would try to sell me something that I didnt need. I picked out a battery that they had in stock, and the gentleman took my old one out and installed the new one within minutes.  Very pleasant and nice. Great job guys!!!","1577":"Terrible. Made an appointment the day before to have a car towed from one location to another. It was the beginning of a holiday weekend, so timing was urgent to get there before they closed. \n\nAfter not hearing from them, I called them in the afternoon. He supposedly had trouble with his truck and was going to send someone else. Just got a call from the backup driver...he knew absolutely nothing and had just gotten an urgent call for a tow. He (the second driver) thought I was stranded somewhere. \n\nSo now, after a no show, no call, it is too late for the car to be towed in time for anything to get done. \n\nWill never call them again...","1578":"We stopped in Treat Cupcake Bar after dinner at Shake Shack. Super cute little cupcakery, but it was too cold to stay and eat. The air conditioning was blasting. We grabbed our cupcakes to go and fled before we turned into popsicles. The vanilla cupcake with sprinkles had a nice cake to sprinkle ratio.","1579":"Owner is super helpful and will greet you upon entering. He'll easily get you outta here under your budget. Asked for a malbec and white wine for gifts and he picked out both my bottles super quick. Stopped in on my way home from work and was in and out in 5 minutes and under my $30 budget. Looks like people regularly stop by to drink wine\/partake in tastings.","1580":"Navarre is now one of my favorite restaurants in Portland.  I love the ordering system of checking off what you want on a piece of paper and having the option of a small plate or large plate.  Every single thing we had was really good.  The service was friendly too.","1581":"Let me begin by saying that Chili's has to be one of my favorite to go spots. I've been to 5+ different locations including locations in New York but this specific location? It is unbelievably horrible, the service is terrible, the food was a waste.\n\nMy sister order was mistakenly mixed up and when we went ahead and told our server her response was \"Well that was what I understood\" I kindly asked if she can correct it and her response was \"It'll take a while before the food comes out sooo..?\"\n\nOur chips tasted old and the guacamole was not fresh. We asked to change it and she practically brought out the same batter with the remark of \"This was freshly made today and it's all that we have\" \n\nI should've spoken to the manager, but once our meal was done we all just wanted to get out of there.\n\nI would not recommend this place not even to my worse enemy.","1582":"So I gotta give praise where praise is due. Jim and his team have completely turned around my impression of this Hotel. We arrived and immediately were taken to our room which had a great view of the river, city and the Fireworks. The room was amazing and once we got settled, a bottle of champagne and desserts came to our room for our anniversary. Jim took care of our room, parking and more importantly  memories of our 17 year anniversary. What a great surprise tonight has been. Jim thank you and your team for your Hospitality.\n\nTony","1583":"I love chocolate and frequent Chocolaterie Tessa (not sure why my reviews do not get posted).  I keep repeating this, but her salted carmels are the most delicious things I have ever placed in my mouth!! ;)\n\nWe recently were on vacation and I tried salted carmels at another chocolate store.  Holy cow...there was absolutely no comparison to Tessa's.  Seriously people...if you have not tried her chocolate, it is worth paying her a visit!  She currently has valentine hearts and other festive treats as well.","1584":"This place is really good at what they do well. The corn fritters that they serve as an appetizer are very tasty. They do a very nice job with the shrimp as well. I ordered the Royal Red fried shrimp dinner and they were just about perfect for fried shrimp, very tasty and perfectly prepared. The atmosphere is basic seafood restaurant style, nothing fancy. The place is large inside and attracts a big crowd of tourists and locals","1585":"I've been coming here since I had my little one and it's such a great shop! They have great prices on things and the staff is very friendly. I'm especially fond of the playroom that my daughter uses while I peruse the racks. It's a great little gem that has saved me a lot of money. The only thing is I wish they had more inventory! They have some cute stuff but it does tend to go fast.","1586":"Friendly service, and great coffee. The food was good, and survice was quick. I would definately reccomned this place for out of towners.","1587":"I live just down the street and so my roommates and I went here for dinner on Sunday. It was great weather to sit outside! Two of us shared the Linguine with Asparagus Cream and the Quattro Funghi pizza. \nThe pasta was good but nothing spectacular. It was more oily than necessary. I would have like a bit more cream sauce also. \nThe pizza was fantastic. Thin and crispy.  And if you're a mushroom fan this will not disappoint! \nI wanna go back to check out the awesome brunch everyone is talking about.\n\nOnly one negative remark: One of the staff was refilling my roommate's water and filled it too much. It overflowed and spilled on her leg. He moved on to the next table without even saying anything... and it wasn't like he didn't see what he did. But I didn't deduct a star for this bc our server was quite friendly and cheerful.","1588":"I'll be up front about this.  I don't really see a difference between the food at this place and First Chinese BBQ or Din Ho.  It all tastes good.  What I think makes Ho Ho stand out is the nicer interior.  It'd be a place that I would want to take company and guests to for a more formal dinner.  Service is also fast and efficient.  You can also see the seafood in the tanks!\n\nThat being said, it is also farther away than either of the other 2 cantonese restaurants here in ATX.\n\nFood was pretty good, very homely chinese feel for me.  We got:\n\n1. BBQ sampler: duck, roast pork and bbq pork.  It was a bit cold which was kinda disappointing. \n2. Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup: Good, its been awhile since I last had this and the flavors reminded me of home.  I thought it was a bit salty, but everyone else thought it wasn't salty enough....\n3. Beef with Chinese Broccoli:Tastes good, nothing special though.\n4. Scallops with Chinese Vegetables: They don't skimp of the scallops thats for sure.  Vegetables are well flavored in the sauce too.\n5.  Some Crispy Shrimp dish: don't remember what its called but it was nice and crunchy, not too much taste beyond the fried though.\n6. Chinese Pork Chop- really good, again something that reminds me of home.  Hard to describe the complexity of the flavors but its a must try.\n7. Beef Flat Noodle- the only thing really disappointing on the menu (my favorite dish).  Not that special and defintiely better at First chinese bbq.  Larger portion here though...\n8. Seafood hotpot- good, but not great.  The broth was on the weaker side, but still retained that unique hotpot flavor.  Too many veggies though.\n\nCome try it if you're around!","1589":"friendly staff, huge assortment of curious george trinkets, shirts, toys and books, prices were reasonable","1590":"If you like traditional German food I highly recommend Schmidt's, the food is excellent and if you like it they have  a dinner buffet any sausage lover could really return for., personally I will go back for the traditional corned beef Rubin, real German potato salad and chunky apple sauce just try the deserts, (look at the strudel in the case before you order, it may not look what you think it should). The cream puffs are n experience you have to experience. A bit pricey but well worth it.","1591":"I've always been interested in the sandwiches-created-by-Boston chefs idea at this restaurant, but everytime I've tried to go it's been like a 36 hour wait, which is really frustrating. FINALLY, on an overcast Friday afternoon at 2:30, there was no wait.\n\nI'm glad that I perserved though. The Flour BLT was an exquisite sandwich, with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto mayo, and great texas toast. Served with some cape cod potato chips, all I was missing was the beach. \n\nGreat place.","1592":"We went for lunch yesterday,  and it was great!  While I wasn't sure what to expect,  the prices were amazing - Super inexpensive.! We got a big fusion mix,  literally.  Had some hot and sour soup,  sushi rolls and Chinese\/Thai dishes.  Great lunch for the price and nice service. I even had a ton of leftovers,  so good!  I would go back for sure.","1593":"Staff here is always super friendly. Sometimes it can get crowded because of various activities that are scheduled, but it's never too bad. Availability to a jacuzzi and sauna make this my favorite 24 in the area.","1594":"Impeccable view of the Atlanta skyline. I suggest you go at night to see all the lights. Fun 15 minute ride","1595":"We love this place.  They have a special on Wednesday's for a soda and two slices of any kind of pizza for $3.99.  You can't beat that!  It's part of our regular weekly routine.","1596":"I found this place with a friend one cold November afternoon and was pretty excited to try it out. This place knows how to pack a crowd inside the building, but they were kinda slow. I have seen other area donut shops move faster. The layout was not very planed well. \n\nWe got 6 donuts and out of the 6 I could honestly only give one a rating, it was the plane glazed donut. Nothing special about it but it had an awesome buttermilk flavor to it. My thought is that if I wait in line for 30 minutes it better be an amazing donut. Sadly I kinda felt disappointed. I think I'll stick to my other shops I have found.","1597":"Hands down THE best frozen custard I've ever had.\nThe selection\/flavors\/combinations--superb!!! \nCome on thru!! Bring your family and friends!","1598":"Max & Dylan's is one of my go to places. Menu items I recommend: Ahi Tuna salad, Mac & Cheese, Clam Chowder. Sooo good the staff is friendly and the drinks are amazing.","1599":"Avocado sauce? What in hell is that? Sweet mother of Jesus, I bet they were serving avocados and guacamole during the inflation crisis of the Seventies. Even the sour cream was runny. The al pastor in my enchiladas tasted like charred bark dust after it had been shoveled from a closed down elementary school on a dreary and drizzly November day. Oh, and enchilada sauce? Must have been an afterthought, or was that it wasn't there because you burnt it all to hell and had a hard time scraping it off the bottom of the pot with a knife? Seriously, to hell with this place, and I'm talking at least Dante's third level.","1600":"I've been visiting this cute as a button, family owned store for over a decade.  It is the most convenient spot for picking up little things, snacks, drink mixes and basically anything else you need off hand.  The same family has owned this place the entire time and i'm glad to support their store over any gigantic mega-corporate one.  The service you receive here is so warm and always with a smile.  Literally, everything you want in your neighbourhood store.\n\nThe selection and quality of the flowers here is amazing.  Whenever I need something just to say 'Thanks!' or a quick 'I Love You' this is my go to place.  You will see what I mean when these flowers bloom and last longer than you would expect from a place that isn't a straight florist.\n\nThey have a large freezer with a small but tight selection (pints!) of Haagen Daz ice cream.  The best part of this is that the mark up is only a couple bucks more than the grocery store around the corner.  Great for my cravings but awful for my waistline.\n\nThe shop is open until 10pm.","1601":"Meh. An a-ok, Intimate place to have a quaint concert. I was left neither disappointed, or amazed. \n\nThe view, on the standing portion of the venue, and the balcony up top was stellar- not a bad seat to be had. However, the venue was a tad too loud for my liking (since the sound bounced off the walls) especially up in the balcony. \n\nBy the way, beware if you sit down in the seats at the balcony, though. The seats smell like someone pooted. You'll have to break out the Fabreeze at home later.","1602":"This venue was so beautiful!! I coordinated a wedding there tonight and it was perfect for the bride and groom! Bride changed her mind about a few of the tables and all I had to do was talk to Paul and voila. They switched out the tables in minutes! Many of the guests came up to me to tell me how beautiful and spacious it was. Crew was awesome and so helpful from start to finish. Very professional and the turnaround for a response in communication is so fast! Love the farm tables, the lights, the backdrop, the curtains, the floors, the bridal suites... I could go on and on! The most important part was that the bride and groom were so happy! This is a definite must for a wedding and can't wait to coordinate another wedding at Ambient Plus Studios!!","1603":"If I could give 0, I would. HORRIBLE service. Took over an hour just standing on line nd another hour to get the car. Made a reservation for a van. The van was not available when we reached there. Then a van pulls up with a family in it nd had to wait for the company to then clean the van out. It was terrible.","1604":"Shout out to Homeslice last night! I ordered a Margherita pizza for pickup. I swung through to pick it up, paid, and then the hostess accidentally dropped the box. It wasn't a big deal, I didn't make a fuss at all because I know sh*t happens in the food industry, but everybody was so apologetic. They started a new one and gave me and my boyfriend free beers while we waited. The manager was so sweet to us, she voided our check and brought the fresh pizza out to us herself (and a cookie!). \n\nHomeslice is my regular. I live down the street, so I always pop in for a slice or get a whole pizza to go. They are my favorite pizza joint in Austin, hands down, and I am so happy to see my loyalty pay off! Excellent customer service last night - thank you Homeslice for being such great homies! :D","1605":"Thia is a pretty neat ride. It is the first thing you see when you come into Epcot Center. It is inside the iconic giant sphere this park os known for the world over. It is a journey through time that begins in Prehistoric times all the way to the present. At least the present at the time this ride was constructed. \nIt is dated and there is nothing thrilling about. It is more nostalgic than anything else. \n\nAs you go up through the different scenarios and reach the top. A projection of planet earth marks the end of the ride. Although this is merely one half of the sphere. You are prompted to play a game in your screen to pass the time on the way down. It feels like they left all that space intentionally empty to add more to the ride with the passage of time, but they never did. It s a cute game. You can see the picture taken while in the ride on your way out. You can even get it emailed to you. \nIt is an incredibly dated ride, but a staple. A must when you visit Epcot.","1606":"Look, I love Nothing Bundt Cakes.  It's yummy, it's moist and who DOESN'T love a good bundt?! \nI've had lots of their flavors (as you can tell by my food baby on certain days), and my favorite is the chocolate chocolate chip.  \nBecause the cakes are so sweet, as is the icing, I highly suggest sticking with the mini bundts.  \nAnyway - enjoy!","1607":"As a former Minnesotan, Jamba Juice was a personal part of my story.  Before going for our token Lake Calhoun or Lake Harriet walks, Sonni and I would stop at Jamba Juice and get a Razzamataz Smoothie with an energy boost.  Wow do I remember those days.\n\nSo, when I saw a Jamba Juice at the Hartsfield Airport, I was like wow, but then I said wait...\n\nI called Sonni.  \"Sonni, quick question, is Jamba Juice as good as it used to be?.\"  She replied, \"Duh, of course\".  That was all I needed.\n\nMy smoothie was 30 minutes of pure bliss.  Pure orgasmic bliss on my palate.  Thank you Jamba Juice.\n\nA special call out to the two staff members.  They were hilarious.  Their banter while my smoothie was being prepared was priceless and make the wait so worthwhile.\n\nKudos once again to Jamba Juice.","1608":"Review is for food only. Last year I was in town and me and a friend were really wasted and ate here. We remember going on and on about how  (surprisingly) amazing the food was. So this year, we're back in town and we're all, we HAVE to order from here for dinner - our drunk taste buds can't be that far off...oh, but they were. We threw most of our food away - even, *gasp* egg rolls. I eat my way through a lot of cheap Chinese places, but this is definitely closer to terrible than good food. I don't doubt it's a fun place to end up at night and by all means, get your drunk food on, but never eat here sober.","1609":"I regret not checking the Yelp reviews first before trying this place, but it was the best I could find in the Davis Square area past midnight, when the 10pm movie we watched at the Sville Theater finished.  It does stay open until 2am, which seems to be the main redeeming quality, and the food was made impressively fast.  \n\nBut then, the food itself.  I got fried udon beef noodles, which were a nice huge portion that could've easily fed 2 people, but they really were greasy as hell and yet strangely flavorless unless you drench them in soy sauce and siracha.  My friend's pork lo mein was strangely NOT greasy at all, but even more flavorless.  Schizhoid!\n\nHaha, it makes me appreciate the Union Square \"Red House\" late night Chinese fast food place that a lot of people complain about, their noodles are way better.  Not sure if I'll be brave enough to chance the rest of this place's menu, after batting 0-2.","1610":"The beef!  I am dropping five stars on this place simply because of the beef (and late hours).  Their roast beef is nice and tender and comes on a crisp and delicious onion roll if you order the big one.  You should go order one right now, as a matter of fact.\n\nAlso, everything tends to close pretty early in Massachusetts.  Except for Simard's.  They will feed you into the wee hours of the morning.","1611":"I love this Salon! The owner is always on top of everything and very customer oriented. They are very accommodating to get you in for the services you are looking for. Recently had the eyelash extensions - FANTASTIC LOOKING. Very natural but added much needed fullness and length. Try this salon- I'm sure you will be very happy.","1612":"I'm in love with their chicken rice lunch special. The atmosphere is pleasant and casual. Staff is kind. Like the sushi bar where they prepare right in front of you. Nice touch","1613":"I didn't have time to get my roots colored before heading out of town, and also promised my daughter I would fix a color block she had in hers so I needed two appointments last minute.  I relied on yelp to help me find a salon nearby.  Found one that wanted to charge $70 as a starting point for roots and $70 to put about 4 foils of lowlights in my daughter's hair which seemed really expensive to me.  Luckily I called master image salon as it had more reviews and was just as close.  Soooooo glad I did. They accommodated us on a busy Saturday, facilities were beautiful, stylists were super friendly and down to earth (you'll feel comfortable walking in in flip flops or heels) and their prices were far more wallet friendly.  The hair washing station was awesome, my daughter's lowlights turned out great and my pesky gray was completely covered.  Everyone seemed very talented from what we could see.  Really enjoyed our experience here.","1614":"By far my favorite KBBQ in Oregon. The kimchi is always pickled to perfection. I've eaten a lot of kimchi in my life so trust me when I say this place has the best. The portions sizes are huge when grilling. The staff is friendly, the place is clean. I usually try and go when it's not busy, cause this place can get very loud. I just wish it wasn't so far away from me. \n\nItems must try would be: \nBossam\nKimchi stew\nThick cut pork belly\nKimchi pancake\nAnd always peach soju","1615":"I was diagnosed with epilepsy over 10 years ago I have sat in a lot of lobby's lol \nI rather have a intelligent doctor who knows what he or she is doing instead of a doctor who doesn't care about me! \nThis man flat out told me that he was going to give me a shot of a medication and it would do 1 of 2 things either stop the seizures or make me go into multiple convulsions, and let me walk out of his office into my vehicle! Who does that! Whom? I really wish I could remember what the name of that shot was, because down the street I went into grand mal after I woke up 3 days later.. I changed doctors.  Now I have found the best neurologist in Austin Texas  if anyone would like to find real doctor not this JOKE check them out:\nhttp:\/\/www.austinepilepsy.com","1616":"About a week ago, my friend and I spotted this place on our way home from dinner and decided that next week we give it a try. \nWe opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead. Sorry to say, we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won't be coming back. \nI hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. \nI asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? \nWe both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally \"drizzled\" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. \nThere is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! \nWe both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!\nThey have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I don't like giving reviews like this, but...that's what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.","1617":"As a former resident of Wellesley who lived there until 1989, one of my cravings every time I come home is the Greek style hamburger and onion pizza. The hamburger is ground up and the taste is so unique. Had the pizza again today and LOVE it. In a Wellesley that has very much changed, Nicks has not and I love them for that. If you are looking for a $50 designer pizza go elsewhere. If you want a real traditional style Greek pizza Nicks is the place","1618":"I ate here recently for lunch and really enjoyed my meal.  I had a Quinoa salad and it was phenomenal.  Real nice bartender.  Great meal.","1619":"This was a bit disappointing as I am a big fan of Samuel Adams beer. The tour is free, but the guides seem a bit bored and so is the tour itself. There's a private lot, which gets filled up pretty quickly.  Visitors may be able to find street parking.  The biggest disappointment was that they only allow you to taste three types of beer, which is selected in advance by them. If you want to try some of your own choosing, you have to go to some restaurant off-site. But they do make sure that the last leg of the tour is their store of merchandise. Has Samuel Adams gotten too commercial and big that it's lost its passion for what is truly important??","1620":"The food was good. The seating was very minimal 10 chairs max at 3 tables. The wait was pretty considerable to with small portions. Good for light to go food or a gluten free option.","1621":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile. I rarely find a restaurant that has a cold noodle dish (one of my favourite things to eat) \n\nThe cold noodles were tasty and chewy! Perfect for hot summer weather. \n\nThe sushi though looked like they were thrown together ... Very sloppy ... And quite honestly look like they were made for a Barbie play set ... VERY small pieces.","1622":"This won our breakfast lottery for today after trying 4 other places that had long lines. We saw there was no line out the door and stopped. It's ok. The prices seem high for such a casual place. About $13 per breakfast. I expect good service, nicely displayed food and a place that doesn't look so run down for that price. How do you screw up breakfast? Make it greasy. I thought this ranked a little high on the grease scale with eggs swimming in butter, limp bacon and gravy on biscuits spreading out over other food. It's ok!","1623":"Here's the deal.  I've never been anywhere NEAR Greece.  I didn't even know how to pronounce gyro until I asked the owner, who is a very nice and approachable woman (like another user mentioned (I wanted to confirm), it's \"yiro.\").  All I know is that I tried the lamb gyro and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small for the price ($9 with some greens that I ended up stuffing into it because it looked bare otherwise).  However, the owner (I think it was her) was super nice and out of nowhere walked up to me and the other gentleman who was there working on his laptop and handed us some \"bagnye\" or something like that.  Basically it was deep-fried sweet balls over honey drizzle, sprinkled with cinnamon.  These were really good.  Granted, I love honey and cinnamon; I could DRINK this mixture all day.  The consistency was just right.  I guess I got on her good side by complimenting the dessert so much that a few minutes later she walked out with another serving.  At this point I hadn't even touched my gyro but soon found myself well on my way to devouring the 2nd complimentary plate of bagnyes.  \n\nThe bread on the gyro was spongy and the meat was flavorful and tender.  I've been to other places where the bread is extremely tough and elastic, and it doesn't matter how good the insides are because I end up just spilling my meal all over the place.  This was not the case here.  The food came out quickly and it was nice and hot.  Overall it was a good experience.  Will return periodically.","1624":"This Starbucks is terrible. Staff is not friendly. My coffee tasted nothing like it should of and tasted more of water then coffee. I'm afraid to even have them correct it with their poor service they gave me to start with. I'll just drink it or toss it. This one is also slow considering it's dragon con and it's packed","1625":"This was a sad day as to are family only went to red robbin because they have good mud pies. But we met by an unfriendly hostess we were sat fairly quickly. After ordering are tiny donuts and mud pies we had to wait over 20 minutes to get are donuts. But to are dismay they was no mud pie and the server told us that they had to give it to another party. Over all the food was bad, the donuts that we got tasted like fish because it was made in the same grease that the fish is made in. The visit was vary unpleasant and left us upset","1626":"Simple this is my favorite seafood restaurant. After going to legal for years Finz has made me switch","1627":"Cheeseboy is awesome. The heavy handed servings of jalapeno are not.\n\nYou have been warned!","1628":"My dear Yeeps, I'm going to let you in on a closely guarded and rather intimate secret of mine. Sometimes, when no one's looking, when the shadows fall just so, and when most heads are turned.. \n\n.. sometimes I dress like an actual human female. \n\nBeyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that don't have thick rubber soles or steel shanks. However, the majority of my available funds after the monthly necessities like rent, food, booze, and hair dye are spent in the pursuit of mountain summits. Sometimes that means money for summit beers or seeking that elusive small town post-climb vegan meal. \n\nThis creates quite a conundrum for your humble reviewer. The infrequent desire to appear what some might call \"attractive\" (or \"showered\" or \"not in tattered jeans\"), but very little money with which to accomplish such lofty goals. Enter: Ether. I only noticed this place when someone pointed it out to me on a bike ride. I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. \n\nMy initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. \n\nTo top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. \n\nAs others have said, the quality isn't top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - it's good enough for me!","1629":"This experience was fantastic. Blue is an incredible server. We had a blast. The Southern burger double patties was absolutely perfect! Try this place out and get Blue. It's worth it.","1630":"Kelly is a sweetheart ... Accommodating, professional, quick & efficient. Who could ask for more?","1631":"The food tasted good. The waitress who took the orders were trying too hard to sell their products (i don't like this). They rushed us when we were deciding what to order. The price of the food was not cheap at all.","1632":"Very average customer service.  Employees aren't too friendly. Went in this morning and asked for 6 bagels sliced and toasted and was given the eat $*** and die look since there was a short line behind me. If you aren't ready to simply toast a few bagels maybe you should have a few more people working in the morning to help with the rush.","1633":"My husband and I were very excited about this store because during our initial visit, one of the guys was super nice and helpful and we bought a bunch of items. He helped us find the right paint brushes and other things we needed for some house projects. \n\nHowever, on another visit, we were walking around the empty store trying to figure out what we needed to get and the guy behind the counter was pretty rude and basically told us that he's closing in 5 minutes. Another guy next to the counter smiled sheepishly and seemed to realize that this was pretty rude. We apologized and as we were leaving, the guy behind the counter told us we could come back another time (um okay thanks for the tip). \n\nConsidering we were the only customers in the store and clearly were trying to figure out what to buy, he could have told us they were closing a little more politely instead of basically telling us to buy right now or get out. It was a huge turn off and I haven't gone back.","1634":"This DD is the absolute worst. Every single time I come here they are always out of normal things, and when they actually have things in stock, it takes forever to get it after you order.","1635":"Great Italian food!\n\nHad a reservation for dinner with the boyfriend.  When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \n\nPros:\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\n\nCons:\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n\nThe interior\/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!","1636":"I was very impressed. There's a huge line always, we went on a Sunday night, there was no line. I'm glad we went bc now I will know its worth it to wait in line. \n\nI'd be happy to go back again with 6 people or less! I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had the steak burrito.  Everything was amazing!!! We didn't get drinks but I can't wait until next time.","1637":"If you have a pair of shoes that you love that need to be freshened up, then this is the place to come. They are true cobblers, on site, who love what they do and it shoes. If my shoes are slipping when I walk, they have a solution. If your heels have a tap that break off, these guys can pop a new one on, no problem. Broken straps, buckles or seams are no problem at this facility. And when you come back, your shoes will be as good as new! Polished and pretty too!!!","1638":"Tony and Tina are awesome owners and have done a great job with the store.  Great prices, clean and always neat new things!","1639":"I called Alliance 4 days ago based on good Yelp reviews.  The owner answered and I started to describe the issue with the garage and I was requesting an estimate. He cut me off and said \"Just text me the address and I'll let you know when I can go by and look at it.\" I wanted to explain some more details about what I was looking for and that I would need to arrange a time to meet him there.  Again, he cut me off and said \"Just text me the address and I'll let you know when I can go by and look at it.\"  I haven't run into someone being so rude on the phone in a long time - and I deal with people and businesses all the time.  I needed the work done, so I texted my address and he responded that he would text or call when we could meet.  Well, that was now 4 days ago.  I guess he didn't want my business. ...  UPDATE: 2 days after I wrote this review, I got a text that he could meet me later that day.  I told him I had already hired another company to do the work.  Other reviews of this company say the response and service was quick. I don't know what happened in my case - there is no way I'm going to wait 6 days to get a response for an estimate.","1640":"Climb the steps and enter into an a-typical Chinese restaurant, the d\u0413\u00a9cor is quite dated and the atmosphere is quaintly tacky. The food is great and the service is better than one might expect for such an inexpensive menu. The cook times are exceptionally fast; especially given the fact you can tell (by heat and taste) that everything is prepared to order. No soggy egg rolls here!\nI enjoy the Hot and Sour soup (w\/o pork) even on the hottest summer day. The Crab Rangoons are a bit different then usual, slightly cheesier and not as sweet as some you might find elsewhere. It is what it is- though very enjoyable.","1641":"Had dinner here last night. Great, fun location! I walked in without a reservation and they were full but kindly offered me bar dining with 20% off. Not a bad deal! I started with a Moscow mule and they served it in a real copper mug! (A lot of places are no longer doing this because people steal the mugs for their value!) \n\nI had the risotto with beef and it was fantastic! The service was a little slow but this is to be expected with such a high volume demand. It's a little pricy but the quality of the food reflects accordingly.","1642":"We were seated quickly and our waitress helped us decide what to get - I got the Mi Casa salad with carne asada. Honestly, it was one of the most full and flavorful salads I've had. Overall, a really pleasant experience!","1643":"Let me start by saying that I love red Robin, but this particular one has horrible service, first they forgot my BF's drink, then they forgot my burger, and they also neglected to refill anyone at my table's drink without being asked. I will probably never come to this location again.","1644":"Lunchtime Experience\n\nAtmosphere: 5 stars - Beautiful view, clean bathrooms, great decor, nice art and hip vibe. Night time I'm sure is really nice.\n\nService: 5 stars - Friendly, attentive\n\nFood: 3 stars\n\nAhi Tuna Taco - Their most popular dish supposedly. Tuna may be frozen but still good. Wonton shell and spicy mayo\/avocado with a little lime was a nice combo. Just NO SEASONING and lacked flavor. I was dying just for a little touch of ponzu or something just to bring everything together.\n\nNative Lobster roll - Great lobster with generous portions. Brioche roll was nice. Again, a lack of SEASONING and just a bit bland\n\nShaved Prime Steak Sandwich- Nice quality prime rib shavings. Horseradish sauce is more creamy and very mild. Its juicy so it soaks up in the bread. Again, a bit bland like everything else. I noticed their picture puts gravy on the side but I think mine was pour over the sandwich. \n\nFritas- Though I complain that everything was under salted and I thought this was OVER salted than most fries. Otherwise, a good lunch frita. Individual ketchup, pretty cool\n\nVerdict 2 stars: I wouldn't be so picky if the prices weren't SO HIGH. Maybe the public has a blander palate but I think this is basic execution to properly season dishes. After tax, this total was $55 for two sandwiches and an appetizer for lunch.","1645":"This is usually my favorite place to come but the wait this time was fucking ridiculous. Some ladies who came and say themself got waited on and acknowledged before we did after sitting there for a good 20 minutes so we got up and left. Annoying","1646":"BE SURE TO READ ENTIRE POST!!!  For years, the guys at April Realty\/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   \n\nWhile they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. \n\nNervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.\n\nThe owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.\n\nThe next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.\n\nThat's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because it's become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say \"Thank You\".    \n\nFinally, we've gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed it's looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.","1647":"I've almost gave up on Chinese restaurants in pdx after all these identical menu at Cantonese places. Husband assured me of trying more. I started researching on yelp on all Chinese places that we haven't tried. This is the one I'm surprised we never noticed. \n\nCheaper than pure spice, but tastes not worse at all. Larger space and better service. I love the cleanliness and the family atmosphere here. Their BBQ closet looks so clean and price is good too! In husband's words: its chi is centered.\n\nI like here because I feel the food is handled with respect. The saltiness is just right. Green onion is there with tofu. Just all so right. Maybe I'm a little biased just because the room was lighted with sun not like many other place that doesn't let light come through window. It might be fengshui, dude...\n\nI'm happy for them that they have pretty good business while we were there. Customer were continuously coming for BBQ. I'll come back to try guifei chicken. If you wanna try real Cantonese way, ask for a LiTang, daily soup(actually broth for American) as soon as you sit down. Drinking that before eating is the Cantonese way of eating. I believe that's why girls in canton are always so skinny. Personally,I always request that and mark down for the Cantonese restaurants that doesn't have it. Making broth is a big feature of Cantonese cuisine. Ask them if you don't believe me.","1648":"We loved the place\n\nHate the Parking..\n\nFood was Great\n\nportions were not filling..","1649":"We went there on Sunday at 3pm the place was still packed. I orders the shrimp and grits which were tasty. It was not something that knocked me off my feet. My friend order the ultimate pancakes with sausage and eggs. It was good but he should have gotten bacon instead of sausage. Overall the place is cool but little pricey with all the other cool brunch spots Atlanta has to offer.","1650":"They have the best french fries in town!  I must say! MMMMM!\n\nThis time I had the special; Ribeye Steak smothered with swiss cheese, mushrooms and grilled onions. Last time I had the chicken fried steak. I was disappointed with entree both times I went. They cooked my ribeye well instead of medium and it just didn't have much flavor. Same as the chicken fried steak. I found it was lacking flavor and excitement.\n\nGreat atmosphere, great waiters\/waitresses. I have eaten at the Hyde Park location before and it seemed to be much better.  I wouldn't recommend this location if you are serious about what you eat.","1651":"This store is the closest to my house, so I have gone here a few times, although I've been disappointed each time.  If you are heading out to do some grocery shopping, I suggest to pass this one up.  There are too many HEBs in the area to spend time here.  This one is dirty, as the other reviews suggest, and do not have better prices to make going here worth it.  The fruit and veggie selection is limited and not very fresh.  There are some shady characters who hang around the lot sometimes.  The staff is not particularly helpful (although some are nice enough).  And typically when I go here, I have to go to another store to get a few more items to complete my list.  I am choosing to drive an extra mile from now on to avoid this disappointing store.","1652":"Ordered food here today, got it mixed up with the other dosa place next door that I usually go to. I haven't been here in a while and I was not happy with the food. The portion for the chicken 65 was so little and salty, as was the biryani my family had ordered. No spice at all and I asked for it to be spicy. Also what they advertise as biryani was not actual biryani, it looked like they just mixed curry gravy into rice, which isn't what biryani is. It was not favourful and the meat portion was so small. On top of that the lamb was tough and chewy. The raita was super thick and had a paste like texture, and the gravy was also salty. I don't think I will return back, the food is nowhere near what it used to be like a few years ago. Highly disappointed.","1653":"Pretty good cuban spot. Only my 2nd time having Cuban cuisine and I was very pleased. Food was good and staff was fun and friendly. I would def recommend this place for a first timer.","1654":"Stopped by for an appetizer and happened to be there during happy hour. Good Rose' champagne and the mussels were perfect.  Had pulled pork tacos good meal and they recommended crostini which turned out to be more bread then topping. \n\nChill place and service was good.","1655":"total punk dive. the music is loud. i used to go here to people watch about 5 years ago. i recently visited and it was the same portland punk scene (a few punky hipsters) this is not a place to make friends. but if you have a few friends and y'all want cheap drinks and good people watching and to be left alone for the most part this is the place to go to.","1656":"Nice price and awesome room. The big guy concierge rocks. He is always so helpfull. Too bad I cant remember his name. This hotel has everything. My husband and I love there.","1657":"Went today with a friend. The food was great.  I ordered the fried black bean cakes with poached eggs and hash towns.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought it was going to be more like refried beans which would've been OK, but this was very tasty...  Looks like they had homemade jam for the toast which was also very good...","1658":"When your wife calls you at work, after receiving an arrangement, and you hear the emotions of joy and happiness overwhelming her all is good.  Thank you for an amazing first experience Beaverton Florists, I'll definitely be back!","1659":"I've been living here for 2 years. Overall, I like it enough to stay.\nPros:\nWendell, the security guard, is amazing. He takes his job seriously & is always willing to help. He will tow your car, though, even if he likes you.\n\nLocation can't be beat.\n\nPool has calmed down tremendously, it's social, but not crazy.\n\nStuff is usually fixed pretty quickly.\n\nCons:\nManagement staff seems to be unable to comprehend complex issues. They do not pay attention to detail, overlook important information, and lose track of almost everything. Make sure you get everything in writing & be prepared to follow up. Frequently.\n\nParking sucks. You will need to pay for a reserved space.\n\nIt's overpriced. And if you pay with a credit or debit card, there's an additional fee.","1660":"So, I was on the prowl for a\nGREAT soup(Not one of those mediocre soups that are all broth and not much of anything else) but a hearty homemade type. Well, \nI was on commercial Dr. And a friend I ran into mentioned this place in particular and what outstanding bowls of soup they had. So of course, I had to check it out! \n So they had two soups to choose from, the vegetable beef or a minestrone. I got the beef and my girlfriend had the minestrone. \nThis place really did not disappoint! Our soups were deep bowls of delicious tasting soup that were hearty, filling and served with a bread! Even even better was the price! $5.50! I would have easily paid $8 anywhere else for the quality and probably would have gotten \"average soup\". We were too full to try their sandwiches but  the guy beside me eating a breakfast sandwich said his was  awesome and he comes for them every weekend! We will be back and absolutely recommend.","1661":"Very friendly staff.  Prompt service.  Our pancakes, scrambled eggs, and french toast were delcious.","1662":"I have purchased a refrigerator, washer and dryer at this business, and I have to say the staff is extremely professional and courteous.  The prices are fair, and the added bonus of delivery (at least $25) and removal of old appliances is wonderful.  \n\nI would not hesitate to go back to them again.  Thanks guys!!","1663":"Had a truly terrible experience at your establishment (413 Main Street Reading MA) last night (October 22 2015 at 5PM).  Crew was incredibly unprofessional.  Yelling, screaming and swearing at one another (especially the large woman in the purple shirt who I assume is the manager)  It was intimidating and horrible as the woman even yelled out the \"F-word\" right in front of us and I had two children with me that are ages 3 and 6.  In addition, the crew was super rude right tin front of the customers.  Chatting about inappropriate things among themselves, talking on the phone, eating in the front end register area, etc... All the while the restaurant and restrooms are filthy dirty and customers are literally being ignored.  This is not the first bad experience I had here.  Last time, it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid's playground where my children were playing!  I know it's McDonald's and not meant to be fine-dining in a 5 start restaurant or anything like that... but this level of disgusting behavior can not be tolerated.  Whomever owns this franchise needs to get it under control. Fire the entire crew and start over!","1664":"This place is awesome for drinking outdoors during the summertime. But every time I eat there, I get a little more disappointed with their food. The atmosphere is great, which is probably why I find it enjoyable to drink there, but the seafood is never good. There is something that could be very cool about paying very little for dicey seafood once in awhile, but this crap food is just as expensive as it would be at a normal\/decent restaurant. I love seafood, and love cheap food, but I just don't like leaving a place feeling like I was robbed, which I always feel here. I will stick to beer only from now on!","1665":"Do NOT stay here! My husband, I, and our younger kids stayed here this last Saturday for a basketball tournament to wake up to a note on the door with $100 charge on our card for accusing us of smoking in our room. We don't smoke and it was not our room!  After multiple times telling them it was not us, my husband even telling the front desk to come to our room to see for themselves they refused. Absolutely ridiculous and not only will we nor the program we are with ever stay here again. Which is 20-50 rooms each year. I will also be reporting them to the BBB as well as putting it out there on any review I can to warn anyone how our experience was. I am disputing this charge with my credit card company but the fact I have to take extra time out to get this fixed is ridiculous. I have left two msgs with a manager with no response.","1666":"Cute place located right on Centre Street with a small patio yet just enough so you can enjoy some of the weather outside with cocktails. Came here the other day for drinks while I was waiting for a reservation at another restaurant and although I did try the food it looked like it would be OK. But the scorpion bowl, two thumbs up as it was strong and tasty!","1667":"I wish I could give this \"0\" stars. Our couch was delivered with two giant rips in the front that had been awfully stitched together in some sort of effort to hide the obvious from us. They then tried to convince us that we knew it was there when we bought it. This could not be further from the truth. I would never spend that much money on a ripped couch with an awful amateur repair job. It was also missing the throw pillows. When we refused to sign for this couch the movers started becoming aggressive and harassing almost that we sign. Once they removed the couch and left I called customer service who offered us an \"in-store credit\" as opposed to a refund. Not okay. To top it off, after the movers left I noticed a giant chunk of my door frame had been taken out  by the delivery guys! When I emailed customer service about this with a photo attached, I specifically noted in the email \" call MY cell phone number, as my boyfriend is not able to answer his personal phone at work like I can\" and gave them my number. Who did they call about this issue? My boyfriend. And then when he told them how aggressive and disrespectful the movers were the \"supervisor\" began chuckling. Not sure why rude disrespectful behavior ir your employees, or employees you subcontract out is funny, but I will be leaving negative reviews now on every outlet possible. Do. Not. Shop. Here!","1668":"The food was absolutely incredible.","1669":"This was one of the first places we went too. Absolutely the best. Happy hour was 1.00 oysters and the bartender Paul I do believe was his name was the best. What a warm and friendly place. Keep up the great job!!!!","1670":"I have to agree with Steve, seeing as how I was the lunch buddy.  The restaurant was dead, there were only two tables and two servers, one of whom was the manager.  She brought us our drinks, took our orders, and never came back... not even to check on the tastiness of our food.  We expected much better service with the deadness of the place.\n\nI had nachos with chicken.  The chicken was shredded, so there were tiny bones in it... I'm glad I didn't aspirate any of them.  That would've been a quick trip to work on my day off, that's for sure.  It was also G-R-E-A-S-Y, oil dripping off of the saturated tortilla chips when I tried to pick them up.  The chips and salsa brought to the table before we ordered our drinks were very generic tasting... like Pace Picante sauce (or, something all tomato) and Tostitos.\n\nPerhaps we would have been better off at Wally's Burger Express next door.","1671":"Large portions for a low price. Fast and lovely service. A weekly venture for me and it never lets me down!","1672":"I continue to be impressed by each facility I visit that is part of Children's Hospital. Granted I am an adult being treated by their doctors I could see myself bringing a child here.  The professionalism and the decor exceed my expectations and you can tell they care for their patients. This facility offers free parking which is very convenient and the walk to the facility after is short. I would highly recommend this location for followup visits because of the parking.","1673":"Came here today for the first time and everything was good. Realllyyyy good cannoli. Also tried a few cookies and the walnut raisin biscotti. It's a to go place so there are no tables. Nice staff. Loses a star because I asked for a cinnamon apple turnover and she did not put it in the bag. I didn't know it wasn't there until I was long gone. I also prefer a place where I can sit inside to eat and have coffee. May return to take some pastries home still","1674":"My only beef with Dressew is they don't accept Visa, forcing me to either bring enough cash when I come.. which I never know how much to take, or use my Interac card which I also never use anywhere else but here.","1675":"Tried this location immediately after they opened. Brisket and ribs had great flavor. I love BBQ and have also been to Blacks in Lockhart. It is difficult for me to say who is better. The flavor and tenderness of the meat at this Austin BBQ restaurant was outstanding!","1676":"It's always a plus going to a locally own place inside a city of tourist restaurants !\n\nI've tried pretty much everything on the menu it's always unique and different dishes. Plus every once and awhile they have such tasty new additional specials .. like their octoberfest soup and lobster soup!\n\nTonight was a great night, even though there were multiple tables with large parties the bartender always came back to us to make sure we were being taken careful. Michael is his name and he always made sure we had a freshly poured cold brew. Which makes the restaurant even great they are always changing their taps.\n\nThAnks for another great night and great service!","1677":"If you like donuts and you like weird eclectic things, this is one of two places you've got to try in Austin!\n\nThis place is really charming, the donuts are eclectic and quirky. The donuts themselves aren't anything too special (they're premade) - but the toppings are what make it what it is! They have fruit loops, cap'n crunch, grape sprinkles and Oreos (with peanut butter and rice crispies), just to name a few!\n\nYou simply must come here and grab some donuts to take home for the family as well!","1678":"Awesome place!  Tom helped us pick a fabulous mattress that was selling for 1\/3 of the MSRP.  We got a king mattress, box spring, frame, and mattress cover for less then 1\/2 the original price of just the mattress.  Tom was friendly, professional, and very helpful.  We had the mattress delivered within 24 hours and he delivery people recycled our old mattress for only $20.  Seriously the best deal in high end mattresses in Portland!  Check it out!  It's a bit of a drive but totally worth it.","1679":"Haven't been to Waterford Lakes in a minute,especially to eat, but Finally a really good restaurant in Waterford Lakes ,from the atmosphere,the food, to the service,everything was phenomenal,spectacular wine list on top of it all, 6stars!!!!","1680":"Caliga often ties up dogs while gardening and yells at them like misbehaved children. She does not appear to rigorously exercise the dogs and generally has several dogs in tow.","1681":"After looking for a nearby non-resort park dinner, we found raves about El Tenampa on Yelp, so we decided to try it. Everything was excellent.  Food was fresh,portions were larger than usual and my wife is still buzzed from her Margherita at last nights dinner(12:30am now at Typhoon Lagoon).  Yes they do need a larger sign and it's not a large restaurant, but it was perfect for this family of five.  And Luis or waiter was very good.  P.S. As my wife learned the hard way, don't rub your eyes after sampling all four kinds of hot sauce on your Nachos(fresh and complimentary).  Good think the Margherita was potent.","1682":"Great food!  Great service!  The interior could use some improvement, maybe some paint.  But the food makes up for it.  Burgers are good. Love the chicken burrito.","1683":"The check in and out was easy.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  I do think the air conditioning was cranked up way to high and very hard to make that comfortable.  The location is Jewry close to the airport.  So if you are just using this location for sleeping I would say do it.  The charter driver was hesitant about helping me with my bags. We were told we could get a ride to near by restaurants which were only 2 options but because he had another pick up he dropped us off at his closest convince and not the one that was discussed.  Where he just walked over to the train station going somewhere else.  The staff at the desk was great.  My review is based on the shuttle driver and the air conditioning of the room.","1684":"I don't think I have ever been to this location without my order being incorrect. The most recent time that I went, I ordered a full size Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT sandwich with no tomato. When I arrived home, I realized that I was given only half of my sandwich with tomato on it. It is not a very close location from my home, so I called and the manager said that she would mail me a voucher since I was unable to drive back to have it corrected. I gave her my mailing address and never received anything. I then had to contact corporate twice to have the issue resolved. I do not see myself going back to this location any time soon, if at all. Save your money and go elsewhere.","1685":"Brought my car here for some basic service based upon a recommendation from my autobody shop. They never open at their advertised time so dont anticipate dropping off before work. No apology after coming in late and having me wait outside in the cold rain for 20 minutes. About 30 minutes late the second time. Not super pleasant, Javier was condescending and never put the oil change sticker on my windshield even though he cut me off to state that the settings would be reset and sticker placed. Was asked to pay in full before service was all completed. Not sure about the quality of work but not low prices (price should reflect work and service). There are too many shop options in the area. No reason to return to a shop where customer service is not a focus and there's lack of attention to detail in their work.","1686":"I go to a lot of Japanese restaurants, and Samurai has consistently been my #1 for almost 2 years and counting! If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.\n\nThe food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\n\nThe service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.\n\nI would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.","1687":"Argh. I just want to preface this by saying:\n I've been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it's pricey for Dim Sum. \n\nDinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don't remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you'd normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.\n\nDim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren't nearly  so stuffed..\n\nThe last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..\n\nThe one that really got our goat was being charged the 'Special' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We've eaten 2 orders of these every time we've been here and have tried the ones with crab (don't like 'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...\n\nSo yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That's insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.\n\nI generally don't hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn't feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed. \n\nI should NOT have to worry about paying the \"Stupid Tax\" here. You know, when you notice there's a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don't even investigate, they just go \"Oh I'm so sorry! I'll take it off!\". .That's the stupid tax. If you've never noticed it on a bill before, you've probably paid it a few times. I'm generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.\n\nI've eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn't a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I've never felt cheated before. If they've changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item\/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they're not just trying to take advantage of people's ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they're sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That's how dim sum works but if you're not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say \"no, no!\" to get things you don't want taken off your table.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I've had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and\/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that's just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced. \n\nWow, this got long. I'm analyzing it like a breakup or something. Sort of feels like one..","1688":"Rating solely on dancing aspect. \nNo cover, easy parking and lots of bartenders. \nPlace was so packed it was very hard to dance. If you like to dance with a group of friends or don't mind being restrained then dj will do. Only heard one bachata song and the rest regueton and hip hop in a span of 35 minutes.\n\nFor those that truly like Latin dancing like salsa and bachata and want to dance, this is not the place. It's not possible to dance with a partner at all or do turns.","1689":"Our group ordered the food at least fifteen minutes before the end of happy hour, but when our server came with the bill, it was full priced. When we asked him about it, he was insistent that we ordered after seven, even though our bills had the correct time. For 18% automatic gratuity, would have expected better. Also, for a group of seven, they put us in a booth, which was incredibly tight. The rest of the place was completely empty when we got there, no idea why they didn't put us at a larger table. \n\nFood here was alright, wings were right amount of crispy and flavoured. Two stars because food quality okay, and in the end they corrected the bills.","1690":"I was looking forward to this foodie experience and left very disappointed.\nFirst course salad-Fabulous\nsecond course Fish-OVERCOOKED \nThirdcourse Waygu beef-OVERCOOKED LEATHER, there were people on both sides of me who attempted to cut and eat and could NOT. I was not the only one who sent my dish back untouched. the foie gras topping  was good, but not enough to help make the beef edible. We didn't even have the option to comment or send it back.\nThe Table should be imbarrassed and ashamed!!!!!'\nFourth course-cheese plate,minimal but enjoyable.\nFifth-Dessert was a home run. Blueberry buckle and flan over duck egg pavlova (like meringue ) and a side of extra mini treats.\nWine pairings were enjoyable.\natmosphere was fantastic\nCustomer service-SUCKED!! I watched them clear FOUR Waygu beef plates that were UNTOUCHED because they were SO OVERCOOKED and not edible.\nNOT ONE CHEF\/ SERVER ASKED OR APOLOGIZED FIR THE DISGUSTING BEEF!!!\nWhen a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesn't find out why... They clearly DO NOT CARE!!!\nThey are \"trained chefs\" and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us!!\nINSULTING! DISGUSTING!OBNOXIOUS!!\n\nTAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us...\n\nNot to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef, they could have cared less.\n\nI am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts ,especially who use local products. BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table!!!!\n\nSIDENOTE- I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING! However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well! A restaraunt  that isn't consistent at that level of \"cooking\/dining\" experience is NOT acceptable. Especially since the owners\/chefs could care less that they served their paying guests OVERCOOKED meat and fish!!! No excuse!!!!","1691":"I walking into this place hoping to just get some coffee.  But when I walked in, I was unsure of exactly what to get.  Mocha? Saudi Coffee? Iced? Since it wasn't too busy, I didn't mind taking more time to figure out what I wanted.  I asked what made the Saudi coffee different from their brewed coffee, and they mentioned it had to do with the spices and cardamom.  Then they started talking about the Fresh Mint Lemonade.  I had to let one customer order before me just so I could decide.  I decided to get the Fresh Mint Lemonade and an Iced Coffee.  The coffee was great and so was the Fresh Mint Lemonade.  The mint was pureed in a blender and then added to the freshly squeezed lemonade.  The customer service is spectacular too, and I plan to go back again.","1692":"Cool little place about to order the mother clucker and a beer","1693":"Happy Feet is fantastic! I had been looking for a good and inexpensive groomer in my aera and after seeing other reviews i figured i'd take a chance. My 9 year old Maine Coon, Unagi, has extremely thick and long hair, and no amount of brushing him seemed to make a difference. He clearly was hot and uncomfortable with all that fuzz, and i cant deny that having a kitty with a lion cut seemed too awesome to pass up. \n\nHe's a big baby and hates leaving the comfy confines of him home, so he cried the whole way to Happy Feet. Within 1 minute of being in Rachel's arms, he relaxed and began to purr and in less than an hour he was looking fabulous and had been shaved, nails cut, ears cleaned and been looked over from ears to tail. Rachel did a fabulous job and made sure he looked and smelled his best while still being comfortable. Her massive amount of experience shows in the great job she does, and her love for our feline friends shows in her quality of work. \n\nI cant wait to bring my other kitty in to have some magic worked on her.\n\nThanks Happy Feet!","1694":"Food was amazing. So much flavor and the sides were outstanding. The restaurant was clean and very industrial modern. Loved the ordering process and the staff was very nice. Definitely recommend the Venezuelan empanadas and the sandwiches. Don't forget the plantains on the side. We will definitely be back!","1695":"So we had well over an hour before our little table for two would be ready at the ridiculously popular Pok Pok down the block. Meanwhile, our biggest meal up to that point on that special first day in Portland was taking individual bites of four yeast-raised monstrosities at Voodoo Doughnuts, so it would be appropriate to describe Jamie W. and me as feeling peckish anticipating our upcoming green papaya salad. When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ujpQ7l).\n\nThey had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet. It was the perfect unintended appetizer on such an eventful Portland day.\n\nFROYO - 4 stars...smooth dairy-free froyo worth seeking out\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...stylish spot that manages to be kid-friendly \nSERVICE - 4 stars...she was generous with the spigots\nTOTAL - 4 stars...froyo appetizers make sense to me","1696":"Worst hair cut ever, not only myself but my husband just needed a trim around his neck , she trimmed around ears etc , all uneven husband told her about it so she trimmed more still uneven ,,,will not return I have given them three times , and don,t say you get what you pay for  the point is we pay for services but are rushed in and out , America take pride no matter what you do do it well.","1697":"Good location just outside of the city. You can avoid toll roads if you wanted (or on accident like me when you're lost haha). There's a nice mall right across the street with a lot of food options nearby.\n\n+ spacious room\n- full beds not queen\n- limited king bed rooms\n+\/- medium sized bathroom with a nice hot shower\n+ nice business center where you can print boarding passes\n+ delicious complimentary breakfast with plenty of choices\n+ lots of parking\n- we had a room near the elevators so we heard every DING","1698":"This is not your typical Mexican restaurant. The dishes are chock full of vegetables. The corn tortillas are thick and homemade. The portions are huge. I enjoyed my dinner here but it was not the Mexican dinner I was hoping for as I didn't research the menu before arriving. \nI would come back again but not for when I have a craving for Mexican food.\nThat being said, the food at this place is very good.","1699":"I believe this is the newest location and it was very busy on a Saturday night. The quality here is a step above the Richmond location, and I recommend VERY strongly for the boneless 3 sauce chicken (san bei ji), one of the best I have tasted. \n\nThe other dishes we had were also very good, including the seafood salad. The xiao long bao dumplings were a bit of a disappointment, however, with dry\/thicker skin and lacking that *pop* of flavorful juice when you bite into it. I would go elsewhere for dimsum type food, but the Chinese\/Taiwanese cuisine offered here is delicious. \n\nFood: 4\/5 (great 3 sauce chicken, lackluster dumplings)\nAmbience: 4\/5, new location, clean, but not too spacious. \nService: 4\/5, typical, but efficient. \n\nOverall: 4\/5.","1700":"I ate both brunch and dinner here this week. The menu is small, but the food is well done and I love the atmosphere. Of all the new spots in Dot, this is my favorite. \nBrunch: my four friends and I were all thrilled with our meals. I had the blueberry pancakes and they were amazing--flavorful and buttery with crispy edges. The bacon and coffee were incredible, too. My only critique (and it's super minor!): the sugar bowl is fully stocked with artificial sweeteners and only 2 sugars. Our table asked for more sugar and was given another bowl with the same setup. Strange ratio. Also, with such high quality coffee, I was surprised not to see liquid sugar on the table. \nDinner: We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. A sweet and personable waitress took our drink order. But then we had another waitress--who was a tad intense. Our group had pizza and burgers and were all happy with our choices. Our waitress forgot about us after a male friend of hers came in to visit. It was odd--she stood a few feet from us, but was too engrossed in her conversation to notice we were done with our meals. We waited a while before the sweet waitress from earlier came by to wrap up our leftovers and bring us our check. We wished our tip could have gone directly to her and the hostess!","1701":"So we decided to stop by even after reading some not great reviews on google and I'm glad we did! We had the ceviche sampler, all three were delish! The mixto was my favorite. We had a group of 5 people, we all had a torta; the grilled chicken Cuban, the al pastor and the pernil. Service was great, I am Latina and I am in the service industry, so I can be quite demanding. Our server more than catered to us, it was a young black female and she was great. I'll definitely be back, I'll be craving that ceviche!","1702":"I LOVE the fried chicken wings here! \n\nThe lady boss is very friendly and if you can speak Teochew, even better. She basically told me her life story on the premise that my mother is Teochew (though I cannot speak it much) :p So I was told this restaurant is related to Phnom Penh, that the owners are related. Hence, the similar food items on the menu.\n\nI have only been here a few times as it is not very convenient for me to get here using transit, plus they also close fairly early. I usually come here during lunch and it is not that busy when I am there. Either people do not know of this place or this is more of a dinner place.\n\nThe pho soup is a bit different as it is light tasting, very similar to Teochew style of noodle soup. The dry egg noodle is really nice, similar to the one at Phnom Penh. The owner also let us try a dessert she made on the house - something with black glutinous rice and sugar. \n\nI saw there is beef luc lac which is something I like at Phnom Penh, I will need to visit here again to try it.","1703":"The best Chinese food I have ever had, not to mention it's 100% vegan. Decent prices, top notch service, and ah-mazing food is an unbeatable combination.","1704":"Steak night is Monday. $6 for a 6oz strip loin which is of surprisingly good quality given the price, and it comes with rice, baked potato, garlic bread and salad, so you definitely won't leave hungry. Also there's a good beer special on Monday, so you can enjoy a cold pint with you meal and get out the door for under $15 incl gratuity. Really, you just can't beat that kind of value at a restaurant. \n\nThis place used to be a Mexican place called El Barrio which had pretty good food too, and although I don't know if the previous owners also own or are involved in this place, but there's still a fair bit of Latin american influence on the menu.","1705":"The beef was the consistency of rubber. The lo mien noodles weren't lo mien noodles. The service was so bad I was amazed my girlfriend tipped at all.","1706":"Uno dei pochi ristoranti nel quartiere aperti fino a tardi. Posto accogliente e piatti molto deliziosi. Si trova sempre posto anche di sabato sera. Ovviamente i camerieri sono gentili. Consiglio il meatloaf. Anche i dolci sono niente male.","1707":"So, Dan from Ashley Chimney Service called me today and I explained that he had measured my chimney cap incorrectly and that I was out approximately $42 with the restocking fee and shipping expense of returning the item. He said he would reimburse me for my unnecessary expense. So I have changed his rating.","1708":"OneZo has a truly unique product in Vancouver! Yes, during their soft opening the staff may have been slow, but you can really tell that they're working hard to familiarize themselves with the Point of Sale system and improving. Mishaps aside, their pearls are made with fresh ingredients, and I think due to the handmade nature of the pearls, they actually taste like little mochi balls! \n\nWhen I went, I ordered the Cactus Tapioca Green Milk Tea, half sweet with less ice. Unfortunately the Cactus Tapioca was not available, but I understood this to because they're not on season. But the baristas were really helpful in helping me choose another flavour; they have so much variety that I wasn't sure what would pair well. In the end I got Black Sesame Tapioca instead. Again about the fresh ingredients - you can literally taste\/feel the tiny grains of black sesame in their tapioca. 100% would come back to try different tapioca flavours & drink combinations!","1709":"Dropped a package off here this morning.  No line, easy and quick.  Got a receipt for my tracking and was on my way a few minutes after getting inside.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly and helpful.","1710":"I love Chipotle, hands down my favorite place to go for a burrito bowl. The food is great, quality, quantity is all good. \n\nThe only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because a couple of the employees give you unfriendly looks when you ask for a certain thing this way or that way but most are great!\n\nTaste wise it's the best Chipotle I've been to so far!","1711":"Food has been going downhill. I ordered a jerk chicken wrap and they out chicken fat and cartilage in my wrap. CARELESS. Also there was sign in the front by the juices it stated something regarding giving out free food \"we do not give out free food #keepyourGHETTOquestions....\"etc. You fucking coon ass . Wtf do u classify as ghetto. As a black owned business how dare you!!!!!humble yourself. Disgusting and offensive. Won't be returning","1712":"Arty low-key brightly painted caf\u0413\u00a9 reminiscent of an artists' studio hidden away in West Newton. Somewhat uncomfortable glass top tables, decent selection of treats and lite lunch.","1713":"I was really not expecting to be wow'd by CBC. I went into the night thinking that a brewery that focuses on making awesome beer wouldn't have the time to get it right on the food side of things. But I was wrong in the best way possible...\n\nCBC sits on the banks of a river in the Brewery District, way off the beaten path compared to most great restaurants in Columbus. Something that makes the experience of CBC a little fun and more like an exploration than just a night out for dinner.\n\nThe menu is deep with good items, I fought it out in my mind over 3 different dishes and was quite happy to hear my friends were deciding over the same items. We ended up getting all 3 and all ended up being as good as advertised.\n\nI went with the bourbon buffalo sandwich which was incredible. The garlic fries that come with being somewhat life changingly awesome, were a complete surprise and a total complement to the BBQ goodness of the sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is nice, somewhat modern with touches of wood and holiday decorations that didn't feel cheesy.\n\nRemeber to wash down your meal with one of CBCs awesome beers. I love the Bodhi double IPA. Great place, great atmosphere, great drinks.\n\nOh and a yelp deal for a free dessert! Get the bread pudding, it's kickass.","1714":"One of the friendlier and less crowded Kinko's in the chain.  I'm always able to find a helping hand here when struggling with the copier and printers.  The system is efficient and effective.","1715":"I made my very first gun purchase here I know somewhat about guns, but I came in knowing what I wanted I asked a lot of questions and the guys there didn't make me feel uncomfortable or stupid of the gun I wanted and it was a very smooth fast process. Definitely looking into more guns and this will be my first stop.","1716":"Great place the staff was friendly the food was great. Got to meet Paul from the show he was great with all his fans. Took pictures with everyone. Really had a great time.","1717":"Great place to go with the family and get healthy salad with plenty of options! I love this place. Very clean, friendly staff.","1718":"This place has bomb chicken fingers! I am one of the pickiest eaters there is and they are awesome! I order delivery pretty often and it has always arrived hot and correct! Definitely recommend you give it a try!","1719":"These guys are fantastic. I had done some damage to my driver's side door when I broke into my own car, after having locked my keys inside. I went in for my routine MA inspection and came out with a fixed door as well! No extra charge. Highly recommend honest and kind folks.","1720":"Excelled in the details! I was in love with the drinks I ordered, Maquis and Ornament and Spice. I also sampled the drinks my friends got. We were all impressed. The drinks are interesting, intriguing, and actually palatable. They make you want more...so we ordered more. The Maquis featured Black Whiskey and had just the right balance between spicy and sweet. Also I LOVED the interesting stories behind each drink featured on the menu. Those are the little details that make for an out-of-the-ordinary experience.\n\nAs a special note about the customer service, the bar was pretty busy on a typical Saturday night, but the staff was calm, courteous, and attentive. It's a relaxed atmosphere, and you feel free to be you.","1721":"FAN-TAS-TIC! After a lovely morning snowshoeing on Cypress, we wandered into Mumbai Masala (though it took as a couple of extra blocks to find it - and only then when someone Googled it on their iPhone). Seems 'off-Lonsdale' is actually rather hidden!\n\nNevertheless, worth the search! Although there was no buffet on today, the gentleman offered us Thali (mixed plate), with both vegetarian and meat-eater options. With two curries and a dhal, rice, the freshest naan I've had in awhile, salad, and pakora (? or something like it), it was an absolutely perfect meal. We topped it off the fresh chai.\n\nThe best part (other than the amazing food - and the eggplant dish was my personal favourite) - only $15 including tax and tip! I want to go snowshoeing again just so we can go here for lunch!","1722":"For some reason, I despise this place.  Whether it's a poetry reading or a throbbing Friday night, it's overrated, overcrowded and I end up leaving within an hour.","1723":"Wow this place has great pizza!! \nI lived in atlanta for 6 years and the only good pizza I had was from Fellini's. Then I moved to North East (connecticut) and NY and that area's pizza is so amazing you can't compare it to anywhere else! 3 years later I came to atlanta and ate here and I have to say it's just as good as Pizza in NY and CT!! SO good! wouldn't think i can find such pizza in Sandy Springs, GA!!\n\nWe ordered:\n- Queen's Right: Excellent! very fresh mozzarella and brazil!\n- Ring of Fire: Great!\n- Mom Says, \"Eat Your Veggies!\": Excellent! I wouldn't think all these many veggies on top of the pizza would make such a great combo!\n- Paolo's Pollo: Delicious!! very good :)!\n- bunch of salads to share. Very good and fresh!\n\nIt was 9 of us and my boy friend and his parents are from NY and they LOVED the pizza! When people from NY like a pizza you would know how good it is ;)!","1724":"I have had mixed experiences at this restaurant. Sometimes there's steak tips are perfectly done and very tender other times they taste like shoe leather. Their pizza is fairly consistent in about average. He seems to be fairly clean and has extremely fast turnover on most of the items on their menu.","1725":"First, let me say this. This is a place that I really, really want to love.\n\nThe people who work here are pretty awesome, and the place feels warm whenever you walk in. Also, they have their slices (cut into squares) openly displayed and a whole gelato section that lulls a visitor into taking a seat, and wanting to sample their offerings.\n\nOver the past year, I've had food from here on four occasions. The first was a catered lunch at our company and the food was very solid (especially the \"Bocce Balls\").\n\nNow let's break it down further. On my subsequent trips, I've tried three different slices, and on my final trip, ordered some \"homemade\" pasta to go. Sad to say, the food has been maddeningly inconsistent. The pizza has never been bad, but then again, it is nothing to get excited over either. The \"homemade\" pasta? I couldn't really judge it, because the sauce that came with it was, and hate to say this, just plain lazy. I'm no culinary expert, but I've made better sauce on my own, and that's what's so frustrating about this place. It SHOULD be good and COULD be good, but after four trips, it is what it is.","1726":"Nice rooms but for a big weekend (SEC championship and Falcons game) under staffed and and room service keeps extending the wait time for food. We just cancelled humus and chips because it take so long to cook.","1727":"Sounds like fun.. here I am, writing a review of something I never got to see... Was it worth it? I will never know... Were the free light displays beckoning me to get off my ass and out into the night with my bah humbug of a boyfriend? Aye, yes. I want to go. Is it too late for me? Please let me know... I have no family, and nothing better to do besides work my swollen ankles into the ground. This lady needs some hot chocolate, a Christmas tree, and a really big hug. Go easy...","1728":"Pretty Dayum Awesome Lunch Buffet!\n\nMom and pop place, great attentive but casual waitstaff.  All the food on the buffet is hot and WELL spiced... everything so full of flavor!  \n\nLots of meat, vegetable and lentil options.  Found that eating the meat items were better balanced when eating with the Basamati rice.  Can't remember the name of any of the dishes, however there is a small description of each dish on the buffet, THANK GOD, because don't you just hate going to a buffet where you are unfamiliar with the food and not much of an idea of what's going on your plate?  Chocolate and lemon dessert cakes were great also, very dense and moist.  Will come here again.","1729":"I've been disappointed the last two times I came here. They're always out of black beans, that's what upsets me most! The first of my last two experiences I had a bowl, the black bean was running low but they just decided to scrape up all the goop of the beans and put it in my bowl anyway! Made me so sick I actually could not keep it down, that should have been my final time but I gave it another go. Again, they had zero black beans, and I can't blame them for that entirely, but still frustrating. I was having another bowl but they were out so I then decided I was not going to get anything, no big deal, but then the manager or owner (I'm not sure) became very flustered. I told him over and over that it was okay and he didn't need to worry but he continued to push and then got me a free burrito card (not complaining) however the young girl at the register was very catty at me, and asked right in front of me \"why does she deserve that?\" I was blown away, very unprofessional, she also had a hicky on her neck, classy. Won't be going back, thanks for the free burrito though!","1730":"My friends and I come here at least once a week. Their service is great and very friendly. The food is always great and there are a few items that are not on the menu that are the specials. You have to ask them about it. It's a nice place to hangout and have a few beers and appetizers. The pineapples ice cream is the best and its sugar free but you can't tell if they didn't tell you. They also deliver also if you just want to eat at home. There are lot of off street parking.","1731":"I would love to leave it at all the nice things I said below but, unfortunately, one of their employees left a very bad taste in my mouth and I hadn't even eaten there today. I was attempting to pull in to the alley behind Taco Deli that I take to get to my parking lot at work and her giant red SUV was parked right in the middle of the one lane alley ( for her convenience of course. Never mind other people that could potentially need that alley clear to get to their place of business.) Since it's not advised to back up in to on coming, rush hour traffic, I was forced to wait for the sassy employee to come out and give me attitude for being inconvenienced by her. Not only did she sit in her car for a minute, she then drive as slow as possible for the 50 yards or so of alley. I then walked in to speak to a manager, who while clearly mortified, had no interest in making sure a very upset regular patron of Taco Deli's left feeling a little better about the business she was entrusted to manage. Not a shining day for this location at all. \n\n\n\n\nI officially work with in walking distance of my favorite taco joint. Breakfast? Yes! Lunch? Yes! Dinner? Nope. The only bummer is the early closing time and  the fact that it is always packed. What else can I expect from a place that serves up deliciousness on the regular. This new job of mine came with the standard benefits and one seriously lucky location bonus. I'm a very happy girl these days.","1732":"Hey there, y'all!  I love Outside in Style on 620 - I had bought two outdoor chairs from Outside in Style last year (still look and feel like new) and just went back today to find another of that same chair and a small, outdoor side table as well.  I was so excited to find my identical chair style for a really great price :). Karen is so helpful, kind, personable and knowledgeable - thank you Karen for guiding me to the perfect outdoor table!  You are like my sister from another mister!  And David, thank you for bringing my new items outside to my car - it was so nice of you!  They look amazing on my porch and I'm so happy :). What really sets Outside in Style apart is that they have indoor and outdoor showrooms so you can see how the furniture really looks and fits together.  And everything is high quality with various sizes and selections - I really appreciated that and it was fun to explore and see which pieces spoke to me :).  Thanks so much, y'all!  Have a great day!","1733":"Since discovering Modern Dog I have been a happier dog owner. The team here has been great with dog walks, nail clips, overnight help, and even delivered dog food to me when I was snowbound! Every one of them is reliable, friendly, trustworthy, and patient with my neurotic dog. The shop is stocked with food, treats, toys, and they'll order just about anything you need. Modern Dog is an awesome addition to the neighborhood","1734":"I've been a fan of this place since they first opened and have the honor of being the most long-lasting customer. A perk of walking in an open door just as they opened. \nVintage from the start has been committed to \"Cocktails done right\" and has definitely matured over the years to provide a warm, casual, and fun atmosphere with a sophisticated pallet. \nHighly recommended and maybe I'll see you there! Or message me, let's go!","1735":"around lunch time, the outside line can be daunting\nbut nothing too bad, ahhhh, their sandwiches i'm now wanting!\n\nfood is delicious and menu is ever-changing \nso i always make sure, to never get the same thing\n\nwaitress was courteous; she didn't keep us waiting\nthe walls are decorated with awards and paintings\n\nso you get a little art, plus a little of their pride\noverall, it's a great place, i give it four stars out of five","1736":"Nice casual day time bar.  Great on a summer day to just kick back, grab a drink with a few buddies, and people watch all day.  It's reasonably priced, good beer selection.  You can't go wrong.","1737":"Very friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Up-cycled chairs with picnic table cloths; it's a humble and welcome transformation from the yuppy, pretentious offerings nearby. Parking within a block is easy. The food is fresh, wholesome and made with extra love (and spice!) I have only been here for the special Saturdays, but can't wait to go back for brunch. Happy that this place is holding on to it's roots while gentrification creeps on by in the shadows.","1738":"Summer shack always provides a stable quality bake and fresh. Definitely drop the tastes of oysters in this season but still well maintained.","1739":"Very friendly, even with our 4 year old.  They fixed a screw in our glasses, which has been fixed 2 other time by other shops.  He took time to explain why the screws keep falling out (turns out we really need to send these back to manufacturer.\n\nDidn't charge us anything for about 10-15 minutes of his repair time.\n\nEven had jelly beans for our kid while we waited.  Awesome.","1740":"Came here with the family for dinner our first night in town. We had been traveling the whole day and I was starving by the time we got there. It took quite a bit of time for the server to even come get our drink order, so I was not happy about that. After we placed our order, things started picking up. The food itself was delicious, with the exception of the lava cake for dessert. When you say \"lava cake\" I imagine warm chocolate oozing out of the Center of the cake when you cut into it. Our cake was cold. It was like someone took it out of the fridge and forgot to heat it all the way. Other than that and the slow service, dinner was fine.","1741":"If you live in the Lake Mary area & you love a great layered look there is no excuse not to go see Briana Styles at Velvet!! \nI live in Atlanta now and have had some atrocious cuts for DOUBLE what Bri cost me AND none of those stylists were half as personable as she is. \nLOVE her, LOVE my hair, just wish she'd consider relocating to Atlanta so I could go to her regularly!","1742":"I feel like this place is really ideal for happy hour. Their prices during that time are really great. I don't eat seafood but I tried the coconut shrimp and it was delicious. Really happy with the outcome of the food and drinks.","1743":"LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME! \n\nThere is nothing original about this show. This Bobby Bones character uses Howard Stern bits (the gossip game and win bobby's money) to entertain his listeners. What really irks me is that he takes credit for other people's ideas. Not only that but he acts like he's some sort of Austin celebrity. He's a nobody. Amy, his close minded female sidekick, offers absolutely nothing to the show other than utter frustration. She can't even get the gossip news right. LAME. \"Lunchbox\" is THE douche of the show. \n\nMy ears start bleeding if I listen to them in the morning. \n\nFor the love of GOD, BUY SIRIUS and listen to some quality radio.","1744":"I just had a root canal done here and dr Ettrich was just awesome. He is very caring and makes sure that you are not in any discomfort and makes the time and has great patience with his patients. I would strongly recommend him. The support staff he has is also excellent I would not hesitate to go back if I need another root canal","1745":"We never got served. So we left. No chocolate. No tour.  There was 2 people working, 6-7 customer and myself and my daughter. No one looked at us, greeted us or acknowledged us at all. We stood, we paced and we walked out. We were in there at 2:30 today...didn't even get to buy any chocolate. What a disappointment. This place is nothing to spend your money on. Trust me!","1746":"So my colleagues and I gave this place another shot- 3rd time's the charm, right?  I'm finding it difficult to find the words to express just how repugnant the \"food\" is that this establishment has to offer.  All of our orders were wrong once again. Weighing my options I figured its better than starving.  As it turns out perhaps I was incorrect as this meal was so low quality I actually felt toxic eating this garbage.  And the cost!  Almost $50 for three entrees that would honestly be collectively priced at $15, tops. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this poor excuse of an eatery.","1747":"Really enjoyed the tour, I thought it was a little pricey only to find a $3 coupon here on yelp after the fact (disappointing), but our tour guide was energetic and engaging.","1748":"Their prime rib sandwich is easily the best prime rib in the Denver area. Tastes awesome, melts in your mouth, no gristle. Just perfect. 5 stars.\n\nDecent beer selection. 4 stars\n\nFlatbread pizza is ok. The pretzels are super good. But nothing can touch the prime rib.\n\nThe service is sometimes great, sometimes mediocre, sometimes awful. 1 star for the awful times (most recently after 42 minutes still didn't have our food).","1749":"They have done regular oil changes and some other maintenance on my wife's Honda Civic. Their pricing is well below the Honda dealership prices, and they do a solid job. \n\nI'll continue to use them for basic maintenance car care.","1750":"I've been wanting to try 7 Lamps for quite some time and finally got around to it. I dined last Friday evening with a few of my coworkers (we have a supper club). \nFor a starter we shared the cottage potatoes. They were pretty decent. Nothing crazy amazing. I also had the raspberry lighting cocktail. It was SO delicious! 3 out of the 4 of us had the black linguine as our entree. I had such high hopes for it! But it was just okay. I felt like the pasta water more than likely wasn't salted. The linguine was still a bit undercooked (not quite al dente) & the sea scallops needed to be seared a little longer. I also would have preferred Parmesan cheese bc the saltiness would have added more flavor to the pasta. I forget our waitresses name but she was a doll! Overall I'll definitely return. The restaurant is super cute and intimate & would be a great date night spot in the future.","1751":"This is by far the best burger I've ever tried! EVER.\n\nI was waiting in line and as I got closer to the door, I still couldn't decide which burger I wanted so I was asking the people around me and I guess that day around me there were plenty of  \"Primetime Burger\" enthusiasts so I gave that one a try. Some of the locals told me they've tried nearly all the burgers on the menu and each has been delicious. \n\nThe Primetime Burger surely did not let me down. The ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors were just absolutely out of this world! You can really taste the difference with Hopdoddy. I had some of my friend's fries and they were good too although no where as unique in flavor as the burgers. \n\nI paired my burger with a Nutella & Chocolate Pretzels Shake, which was amazing as well! \n\nI'm not sure if the lines are usually as long as the line was when I was in town so I would recommend getting there a bit early because my friends and I had to wait in line outside, inside, and then a bit more after we ordered our deliciousness. Trust me though, it's 100% worth the wait! While you're waiting, you can order a \"Grown Folks\" drink at the bar if you're of age of course. \n\nOverall, a really pleasant eating experience!\n\nHopdoddy, please come to Los Angeles - I promise you'll be oh so loved there as well! :)","1752":"Came here last night looking for a Christmas gift for my infant niece. I definitely found a lot of nice things! Ended up getting her a soft blankie and Jellycat rabbit. \n\nMy toddler son was with me and going a bit wild, he kept wanting to play with all the toys and books. One of the women working decided to entertain him while I browsed. She got down on the floor with him, and they were looking at this Eric Carle cardboard cutout kit for building animals. My son had dragged it out and didn't want to put it back, so she was going through all the animals with him and talking to him. It was really sweet of her and helpful! We ended up buying it, of course. \n\nI thought things were a bit expensive here, but then I checked prices on Amazon and they were the same! I'm sure we'll be back.","1753":"I saw this place on the way out of town a few weeks ago, and had to check it out the next time I was in town. With hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida, I stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner. Other than another pair that were already seated, I was the only one dining there. \n\nAfter reading the reviews prior to mine, I was a bit cautious about eating here. I had not eaten at any other Bonchons before, and this was my first experience at one. I have to say that it was a great experience and the food was awesome. \n\nI had the small combo wings\/drums in half spicy and half soy garlic. Both tasted amazing and the crispy-ness of the wings were on a whole new level from what I've had before. I have to give the prize to the spicy flavor, it's really good and not really that spicy. \n\nI also ordered the bulgogi tacos. They were super tasty and I'd definitely recommend them as well. \n\nI plan on making this a regular stop for me whenever I'm in town!","1754":"John was quick to return my call, communicated well, came on time, and most importantly did great work. There was a minor hiccup where he left a lever on that caused the heat to bypass the thermostat but he quickly returned my call and walked me through the process for a quick fix. I would highly recommend. Went through a few other services in the past and John stands above the rest","1755":"Busy on weeknights.\n\nInterior is fine for a modern restaurant. Nothing dazzling.. But it's been around for a while. Comparatively, it was really nice when it opened.\n\nService excellent. Loved that your napkin get reset\/folded when a person leaves the table.\n\nPoor menu design! It's one huge rectangle. I wished it folded in to 3 sections like most menus's. 4 people sat at a table, each with their menu in front of them covered the whole table top and then some.\n\nThe items on the menu were vast and it took us all ages to pick our food.\n\nFood quality, quantity and taste were excellent.\n\n**** Happy hour specials were really value priced. :) *****","1756":"Always exploring new places, I tried Hollerbach's cafe \/ restaurant, and I really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is like a lot of family-run restaurants--informal, comfortable, a lot of bric-a-brac all over.  The customers all seemed happy and talkative which I think is a good measure of the restaurant's success in making a pleasant atmosphere for people to eat.  And the staff was friendly and answered all my questions happily.  The guy who waited on me at the bar couldn't have been any nicer.  I had a Wurst Teller plate with 3 different sausages, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes (pancakes aren't shown on the menu) for sides, and a couple of Kostritzer schwarzbier to wash it all down.  Every single thing I ate was wonderful here.  Rich, flavorful sausages, spicy German mustard, warm and flavorful German potato salad, the excellent German beers on tap.  My only regret is that I ate so much that I didn't have room for dessert--they have some very tempting things in the display case.  (I saw a cheesecake and some other cakes in there like a German chocolate cake (which isn't a true German dessert, by the way), a black forest tort).  Also, I saw German beers on tap like Bitburger, Kostritzer, Tuch, and a couple others, which is pretty representative of the spectrum from pils and ale to dark.  Didn't see Spaten das Optimator, or hefeweizen, but I didn't look hard, either.  I asked for one of their world famous Reuben sandwiches with the red cabbage on it for carry out--it was terrific.  This was just one visit, but I really like this place and want to go again to explore more items.  Six stars if you like German food.","1757":"We couldn't wait, we had to taste the real food. So another date night spent in Malden. I had a Goddess Martini to start... no offense to the bar tender but \"ICK\", way too sweet for this sour girls taste buds. I had to switch to a glass of Pinot Grigio to go with my pan seared scallops over Lobster Ravioli with a lobster cream sauce. Very tasty indeed! And the hubby had a veil cutlet special over risotto and three shrimps. I didn't get to taste the shrimp, cause he's greedy, but the veil and risotto were delicious.\nI liked the small portion sizes too because I didn't leave the restaurant, for once, feeling like a whale. The music was a bit more mellow too, which was nice for dinner time. Just quiet, holiday music in the background. The wait staff was great. Very friendly and efficient.\nI think we've found a new place for date night.","1758":"I ordered the colossal cobb salad and was not impressed. The ham felt like I was eating hard wax, which made me sick to my stomach afterwards. I really want to like this cart, and plan on getting something else next time.","1759":"The happy hour is great, they also have appetizers included. Even when the restaurant is really busy, the costumer service is outstanding. I would definitely recommend this place. ( just for the happy hour)","1760":"This is around the corner from my house so it's often a go-to. \n\nI would say if you are craving run of the mill Tex-Mex, this is it. The waitstaff are less than excited and don't hide it. I try not to sit in booths, for whatever reason the service declines along the walls?? Needless to say, it's an easy place to go where you will never encounter a wait and the food will always be consistent. \n\nI believe on Mondays there is an all night happy hour of drinks and food. Always a plus.","1761":"A sports bar with bar food. It's not bad, but it's not great. The place is well kept and definitely has a massive amount of TV's, as well as outdoor seating. The waitress told me it gets really crowded during the night, I'm assuming that's for the bar, since they have a extensive alcohol options.\nWe went for lunch and started with the spinach and artichoke dip, and it was pretty bland. I think it was reheated and brought out. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries, both were decent. The prices are average and portion sizes aren't anything to get excited about.\nSeems like this is the ideal spot for beer, wings and a ball game. All 3 of which I had none of during this lunch.","1762":"Made an appointment thru yelp. I was taken back within ten minutes of my appointment. They took my vital signs and sent me to an exam room. I didn't have to wait long. The doctor listened to my story and approved all the tests I wanted\/needed. She did an excellent examination. They have an online portal where you can check your test results for the ones that needed to be sent out. Some tests can be performed in the office. I would return again if needed.","1763":"I realize this goes against the majority of reviews for this restaurant, but my experience left me underwhelmed. \nThe Kenpachi was sold to us like a salesman sells a car, \"This is the only place in FL\" and similar statements. It was a $46 dish that tasted like a salty, squashed and seared frozen fish fillet. The veggies were stated as, \"from The Land\" in Epcot. Who knows if that's true, but they were under cooked. I like them with a bit of crunch but they were more hard than anything.\nThe New York Strip was ordered medium rare and it came well done. Our waiter said it was good that we sent it back because it was a viened piece of meat. This brings me to a different complaint. Why are the people that help us make our order not the ones that bring it to us? As a customer we are left wondering what to do until the waiter has time to check on us.  \nThe lobster tails were not the melt in your mouth that these Nova Scotians expected. Lesson learned, eat lobster where lobster is freshly caught.\nNow for the good - my husband LOVED the Chilean Sea Bass. The appetizer of Cheese Evolution was fun to try and share. So 2  stars for those dishes.\nTwo dishes were sent back with no apology. They just gave us the opportunity to order something else. It seems like the the expensive restaurant doesn't have to work hard to keep customers.","1764":"This location did a 180! Not sure if it is under new management but the location was completely renovated and everyone we've come across so far has been incredibly professional and friendly. We even had one order made slightly incorrectly so they made us a new one immediately, let us keep the old one and on top of that, added a 2 liter of soda for free for the inconvenience. So glad this location shaped up!","1765":"The dishes here look so beautiful and taste very nice.\nI strongly recommend seafood curd. It contains a lot of seafood and Chinese vegetables.","1766":"I recently moved to the area so I have the unfortunate task of trying to find a quality nail salon. I found This place and because of the many positive reviews I gave it a chance. I called 20 minutes before to see if they accepted walk ins and was told by the gentleman who answered the phones they did so I took the drive to the salon. Upon entering it was very dark, maybe because they call themselves a spa it was part of the ambiance. It was not very clean and many of the stations seemed to be crowded with junk. I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure. I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors. And most of them seemed old, definitely not a color selection that's impressing. The guy doing my nails seemed to be in a rush and was not paying attention to what he was doing. My nails were not filed straight and when I pointed it out he got annoyed. Then when buffing my nailed he cut the skin on my fingers. Don't even get me started on my cuticles that are worse now than when he started. I will not be back, and maybe it was just my experience but it was not work the $30 they charge for a crappy \"manicure\". Look at the other options in the area.","1767":"Everyone I encountered at this clinic was great! They give awesome customer service, they have uplifting attitudes, and it continues after the service for which you came has been provided. Dr. Slater listens to your concerns and even during your procedure, he addresses sudden questions. Dr. Slater was very gentle with my lip filler procedure. Except for one injection where I felt some pressure, I didn't feel any of the other injections. At one point, I was going to ask him, \"Did you start yet?\" I received Juvederm Volbella because I only wanted filler in my upper lip because it was very small and thin in ratio to my bottom lip. Also, I wanted a more natural looking lip, rather than one that has obviously been filled. When Dr. Slater completed the process, I was shocked because there was no bleeding, during or after the injection and I never bruised either. In the next 3 days, my lip did not swell above that which it appeared at the clinic. The overall experience from start to finish was perfect! I have a follow-up in 3 days and I'm going to consult with Dr. Slater about getting more Volbella.","1768":"$15 lunch and we are always hungry an hour later!  Good fresh food but PORTIONS ARE SMALL AND IT'S $$$...  Dont' get me wrong....I like cafe at pharr.  I've been to most of the locations around town.  The food is always consistent and fresh but my friends never want to go there because we walk out after a $15 lunch and we are hungry an hour later.  This happens EVERY time.  All the buckhead bettys at the Peachtree Rd location obviously are on a diet and don't care about this....but everyone else does!  I know they do a lot of business at that location but I think the owners would do a lot better at all locations if they either brought the price down a couple bucks or at least gave you 25% more food.  Personally I would be OK with a $15 lunch but I want to feel full afterwards!","1769":"Absolutely the best vegan tacos, or any tacos, in town for sure. Huge problem though is the service recently. We've been going here for a long time and always encountered super friendly people, but recently it's been terrible. Really pretty girl with shaved head seems to always be in a bad mood. It's so incredibly off putting. Last time she seemed annoyed that we asked about our order (we were waiting almost an hour and just wanted to check in), and then annoyed that we asked if they would mind refilling the hot sauce because both were empty. Now today, at 11:30am on a Sunday, she was deterring us from ordering saying \"it's going to be a long wait, you're better off ordering at Bon vistro\". I said that's ok, we'll wait, and she rolled her eyes and seemed annoyed that I still wanted to order tacos. I was so taken back because I don't ever expect someone to act so annoyed with a customer for no reason and especially don't expect them to deter me from ordering. I'm uncomfortable ordering when I see she's working. Huge bummer for such a good food truck. 5 stars for the food but the 2 stars is to alert the owner this is a huge problem. We heard her be rude to multiple people and we saw peoples faces shocked and confused by it as well.","1770":"....So, you know when you read Yelp reviews that are terrible, and you say to yourself, \"Okay, angry human.  Write your yelp review and take some deep breaths. It's not a big deal.\" WELL, I've never written a yelp review until this place. Not only haven I physically gone to this place a few times, but I've lazy-lunch ordered with friends through Uber eats from here. Intercom apparently broken in drive-thru. (sat there for about 5 minutes before I reversed and went to the other one, so that review was true) Immediately I noticed the fries had the oddest rotten taste, and chicken CLEARLY wasn't cooked through (and that's saying something for McDonald's). The icing on this cake was when I ordered through uber eats. I ordered three meals with friends, multiple drinks, desserts, and even breakfast for the next morning (to make the uber delivery fee \"worth while\") When the delivery arrived, the driver said, sorry, this is all they had... and handed be a 10 piece of chicken nuggets. TELL ME THEY DIDNT HAVE FRIES, SODA AND BURGERS LIKE WE ORDERED? bdjsudyisnsjwukdhsjsj","1771":"Yum. This afternoon was my first time to go to El Chilito's. I'm eating a Carne Asada taco right now and it's pretty tasty... but it's also ity-bity! So even though it seems like a pretty good deal to only pay $2.29\/taco, you better get two or three if you want to be full. \n\nMmm... really good, though. And the salsa\/mole is also amazing. And the tortilla seems like it would have been really good a day or two ago (right now its a tad stale). \n\nOther people said the line was long, but when I went it wasn't too bad. Maybe 10 minutes to get in and out. And the cashier-dude was really friendly (and kind of cute!) \n\nI'll definitely be going back.","1772":"Came here for dinner after a few friends recommended the place. It lived up to the rave reviews - I love, love, loved this place! We came for dinner and it was busy, but the atmosphere was trendy and fun. The only downside of the open concept is that it did get a little noisy at times. \nThe margaritas are to die for - try the strawberry! The alchol wasn't over powering, but they were definitely strong :) You get chips and salsa while you wait for your meal and the salsa was seriously the best I have ever had. It was a little spicy - my less adventurous husband was sweating a bit! I had the chicken fajitas - SO MUCH FOOD! The chicken was grilled to perfection with a mix of veggies, the rice was deliciously spiced, and the guacamole (an add on) was wonderful. I also had a bite of my husband's chicken enchiladas and could have eaten the entire plate. They were extra cheesy, just as I like them. We will definitely be back!","1773":"I wanted to write a review on this little Gem in Winthrop.  I have been going here for about 2 years now and have always been pleased with their talant.  I first started coming to this Nail Salon after I had a disaster of a Nail Job done the day of my wedding at a Nail Salon at Square One Mall.  I now have learned the hard way that you never get your nails done in a Mall (Especially for a big event) because they want to take in as many customers as possible they do not care how the end result looks.  I left the Mall so disappointed and on my way home I decided to see if any of the Local Nail Salons near my house could help me.  The first place I went to could not help because they said it would be too much work to undo what the other place had done.. I decided to try one more place and Thank Goodness I stumbled across A & V Nails Salon.  The Ladies their helped me redo the nails that were done at the Mall and Did a fantastic Job.  I knew It being my Wedding day that my hands were going to be photographed so I can not thank them enough for  their help.  I have been going there for Business ever since.  The staff there is very personable and they remember me everytime I come in the door.  They are all very talanted and hard workers.  If you are close to the area and need a good mani or Pedi I totally recommend trying them out.","1774":"I really like this place.  It's cozy and dark, and the service was REALLY top notch when my husband and I stopped in.  Easily the best service I've ever had in a bar.  The cocktail menu is varied, with many slight twists on classic cocktails.  They are a bit pricey (8 bucks and up), but as others have pointed out, they are indeed STRONG.  I had two drinks and was pretty buzzed to borderline drunk (note: I am a person who has a couple of drinks every night after work, so I am not really a lightweight).\n\nI ordered a French 75, which was good, though sadly not the best I've ever had.  Then I ordered the chocolate martini, which was AMAZING.  It's thin and tastes like pure cocoa, not thick and sugary at all.  My husband had the Corpse Reviver #2, which he proclaimed to be fantastic.\n\nWill definitely go back.","1775":"Not upset just disappointed. We waited over an hour for rolls and a few apps. The fish and soy sauce had little flavor and the rolls were very very small. Left hungry and sad :(","1776":"I visited Tarrytown UMC for the third time this past Sunday. It was my first service in the Fellowship Hall, with David preaching, and I have to say it was a wonderful experience. The kiddos had just had their Vacation Bible School and performed, it was adorable and sweet. The sermon was touching and thoughtful. The hymns lovely as well. The icing on the cake was a gentleman, Tim Curry (for real!), who performed \"Go Down Moses\" during the offertory. I would have paid good money to hear that man sing in a killer jazz bar. It moved me to tears. Please go at least to hear Tim sing. Good God. The people were super friendly, the childcare too. My daughter cried when it was time to leave.  I will definitely be back and look forward to the excellent preaching and music. I'm subtracting a star because the parking is challenging. I know they are working on it-I asked-so give yourself a few extra minutes.","1777":"I ordered food for the Boulder office and arrived here only to realize I had placed the order at the Denver location. The manager on duty decided to make me the order again and never charged me again. This is an amazing business to have bailed me out of my own stupidity","1778":"First time to Orlando and try to find a good place for sushi. This restaurant is nice and everything we had was good. Highly recommended!","1779":"Don't waste your time stopping.  They don't have what they advertise, and don't answer the call button.","1780":"I'm not the kind of person that writes reviews, but I had such a great experience picking out my prescription glasses that I had to make an exception. \n\nThis was my first time at Warby Parker and will not be my last. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked if I had been there before (which obviously was a no) and then they explained the different sections of the store and told me that they would give me a bit of time to browse around see if anything appealed to me. I started looking at all of the frames on the wall and every time I would pull some off the shelf and try them on, I didnt like the way it looked on me or the way it felt on my nose. I did this a few times and still had no luck and became extremely overwhelmed very quickly. After about six minutes or so of doing this, one of the employees came over and started to pull things off for me to try on. The frames that he picked I would have never chosen for myself. And I freaking loved them all. I have extremely terrible vision so my lenses tend to be very thick and weigh down my glasses. He asked to see my prescription and recommended different frames that would be comfortable and fit well when the glasses were made. Two employees assited me while I was at the store and not only were they extremely well informed and helpful, but they were so incredibly kind! I've never had such a great experience picking out glasses before, ever. I've always been the kind of person that wears contacts out in public, but I'm definitely going to be wearing my glasses way more often because I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ones I ended up buying. And I would have never picked them out if it wasn't for those employees. I told my brother about the experience I had and he's going next week to check it out! I will never go anywhere else for my glasses. \n\nWarby Parker, you just got yourself huge fan!","1781":"Sushi to go on Denman Street near Stanley Park\n\nReasonably good sushi at a touristy location.   Although you can eat there, we took our sushi and tempura to go ... it was \"good enough\" - what else do you expect from a fast food style place on a tourist strip?   There is far better sushi (really good) in Vancouver, but not at this price point near this location.  For what it is, it was a good value.","1782":"Don't change a thing, Eurasia!! This place has quickly risen to my top 3 favorites in Austin with just one visit!","1783":"Trendy atmosphere, and if this was just a cocktail bar I'd give it five stars. Unfortunately the food menu sounds amazing but was just so so dull. We'll definitely come back for drinks but that's it.\n\nDrinks:\nJuniper - Delicious.\nStrawberry Fields - Super interesting and addictive!\n\nAppetizers:\nPatatas - Pretty tasty.\n\nEntrees:\nDuck - The duck was well prepared, and each ingredient tasted delicious but somehow they never actually combined into a proper flavourful meal. \nBison - It was heartbreaking how bland it was. Absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it was literally just meat and corn. Maybe if they had enough puree to use as a dipping sauce it would have been better.","1784":"Me and My Family have been eating here for Years and we love it!  It is different than most place but that difference is good!  Some times you get things that you didn't think you ordered, but that has gotten a guy like me(who always eats the same thing) to try other stuff on the menu. EVERYTHING IS GOOD so you cant go wrong.  The nuns are starting to speak better english so there is less awkwardness and less screw ups on your order.  Also I have witnessed many people without means not having to pay for their meal so this place is also helping our community.  I have eat here probably over a thousand times and have never got sick!!!  If you are a vegan that likes likes fake meats or are not a vegan and are trying to eat good with vegan friends or fam go here and you will not regret it!","1785":"Went last night at 5:30 with 2 friends. We each ordered separately and we're lucky to find a table.\n\nMy order arrived at 5:50, barely warm. The next order was delivered around 6:00, after inquiring with a server at 6:15, the order was delivered at 6:25.\n\nThere were also numerous tables also waiting for food, some went to the counter and asked for refunds.\n\nEven though the store has only been open fora week, corporate should have at least some experienced staff from other locations to ensure a successful opening week.\n\nNot related to the bad service, one of the windows was boarded up,.\n\nNever again.","1786":"I have a 2001 Golf and do most of my own work, but when it's over my head this is where I go.  These guys are honest, knowledgeable and very helpful.  Their rates are very fair and they're willing to help me over the phone when I have questions about my own repairs.","1787":"For me I am a fan of the concept here with fresh ingredients and the ambiance is fresh and modern.   I find the pizza we had were very tasty and fresh.   The prosciutto and pineapple was very good and full of flavor, a nice alternative to a Hawaiian at most places.\n\nHowever, that being said the service was not good at all here.   It was filled with a handful of guys who were mailing it in.   Several didn't speak enough English or didn't know the menu.   When ordering drinks, they didn't know what they had, which was strange to me.  Our drinks didn't arrive until the food arrived.   I think this place should be excellent if they can work on their service problems.  Pricing was pretty reasonable and I would try take-out from here hoping for better results.","1788":"Adulting can suck at times not to mention insurance can get a bit confusing. I had an amazing experience with State Farm by talking to Howard Lao discussing my options on car insurance. I've been looking to switch to reduce my monthly payments I am currently paying with another insurance company. \n\nHe made it sound so much less confusing and even gave me an estimate if I was to switch. He was super friendly and went above and beyond to help me this day. Not to mention gave me a clear understanding of where my money is going towards in terms of coverage and such! I'd highly recommend seeing him if you're in the Portland area.  \n\nThanks How!","1789":"As good as it gets for all you can eat\nI had low expectation for this place, which is probably why I was pleasantly surprised. The aburi sushi tasted good, of course not compatible to Miku and minami, but still delicious. The meat's flavor was really good. There are other neat little surprises like deep fried mochi and such. If you got a big group of heavy eaters, this place is perfect for you","1790":"Very nice and clean place to eat. Loved the atmosphere and music. Service was great and the food was the best part! I wasn't sure my kids would like it but they really loved the food!","1791":"I'd like to update you all on my situation below with my \"rebate\".\n\nI went back into the store and spoke to yet another store associate, Kevin, who informed me that the sales associate I had originally dealt with was no longer with the company.\n\nFrom there he called some sort of manager who told me, sorry you have to keep the gift cards we gave you.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE.\n\nI was told it was a rebate. Actual money not gift cards to home depot.\n\nFrom there Kevin called a regional manager who finally agreed to refund my credit card the $300.\n\nSound great right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nThat was almost two weeks ago. No refund. and now I can't even find Kevin - isn't that convenient.\n\nSorry Sleepy's but I am NOT giving up. You owe me $300.\n\nI am now filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Hopefully that will get me a response...or maybe I can find Kevin...anyone know Kevin???","1792":"There's no need to go to Newbury St with talent and service like the team at Judy Jetson. I went to Josh on a recommendation from a friend. He looked at the photos I brought with me, and then we discussed how the look would play out on my hair, what I was comfortable with, etc. It truly was a conversation and made me feel very comfortable with him holding the scissors. The cut turned out great and I've gotten tons of compliments on it. The next day, I got a call from Judy herself to follow up and make sure I was a happy first-time client...which I definitely was!","1793":"I went here for the first time a few months ago with a gift certificate from my husband's boss.  I had the most fantastic prenatal massage from Kim. Like made my week kind of massage.  Not only was she courteous, professional, and awesome at her job,  the spa itself was lovely. The staff were very friendly and low key and there was a quiet, relaxed waiting area. All around great experience.","1794":"Cool environment right on the water and nice and open so get a good breeze.\n\nThe food was solid but expensive. Seems a bit overpriced for the laid back feel of the place. But overall a solid eat if you don't mind spending a little more.","1795":"I have never been a part of a more engaging dining experience. I am WOWED, blown away, out of the water!!!!! The service holds itself to a high standard of excellence and the low lighting provides a comfortable atmosphere. This place is perfect for special occasions or just to satisfy a craving. \nYou can do all 4 courses or just 1, up to you! \nIf you decide to come here make sure you stop by the bar and say hello to Erin, an excellent bartender and person in general. He will ensure your party has an unforgettable night and the best cheese of all the employees ;)","1796":"Ummm.... Awful all around!  Please save your money and go somewhere else.  Service is the worst.  And you will be waiting forever.  Seriously,  plenty of other places around Disney that will take your money!","1797":"Wow, the service here was superb. Definitely make reservations and come before closing...it's super busy and definitely deserves it's awesome reputation. Also be prepared for the LACK of free parking......However, the restaurant does offer valet...so do it...trust me. Also I recommend dressing nice here...it's a bit above your casual dress.\n\nWent here for a girl's night and ordered the following:\nGruyere biscuits - solid awesome. Get those freaking biscuits. They are worth it. \n\nFries w\/truffle oil- good reminds me of umami fries in CA but not to die for personally. Just do it to try once for the experience\nRavioli that day was not that great or worth it. Come here for meat. No pun intended. \nGet that pork porterhouse. Seriously. \nI also recommend the chicken was delicious.","1798":"What can I say? The food here is excellent. You do get a lot to eat. They also have a senior type menu called \"little less dinner\" (or breakfast, or lunch depending on what you order) and the great thing about this menu is its open for all ages. That I like, as not everyone can eat a huge meal. As I and many others here said they do give you a lot to eat and having a \"lite\" menu really helps. Plus this \"lite\" menu is the same food as you get in the normal menu just smaller portions. \n\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner is served all day. They have a jukebox that plays all sorts of old time 50s music, (just like a classic diner) \n\nService is by far the best I've seen in a casual style restaurant. The staff are very friendly, almost like being in a small town diner.\n\nDeserts are also big, big enough that two or even three people can share it. and fresh squeezed orange juice served daily. \n\nPrices are average. dinners such as the Chicken Fried steak, salmon or the normal streaks can run $10.99-$15.99 and drinks $2.50, but I guess you are paying for quality and that excellent service.","1799":"Artisanal cheese appetizer was good. Took 15 minutes to get our waitress to the table another 15 to get my drink to the table . Risotto was great! The steak was over salted & I couldn't eat it! Sorbet was terrific! Potato bread was so tasty! Sushi appetizer was awesome! Would I go here again on my next visit probably not!","1800":"Overpriced and too much frufru...\nVery noisy and not a good selection for lunch.\nToo expensive and over spiced.\nTried four tomes nut still disappointed.\nSeasons 52 much better!!","1801":"My all out favorite eating establishment in Boston, because who doesn't love waffles and french fries? Not too mention oodles of mouthwatering sauces that should leave you coming back all the time. If you haven't tried all the sauces, you truly haven't experienced Saus, and that goes just as well for the waffles. I took my girlfriend here for deep-fried turkey fest and we had a ball! I'm a french fry connoisseur of sorts, and these frites are miles ahead of the competition. Also I don't think I've ever met a nicer staff in any eating establishment, and there's something exciting and new every month! Check out Tuesday night board game nights and grab some frites! Can't tell you how many times I've left campus to sneak away here before the next class. Love this place.","1802":"Their chicken fried rice, or any of the fried rice is fantastic. It only comes with onions and peas and your choice of protein but boy are those veggies fresh. The family is always welcoming and the food is always a great choice.","1803":"Well, I thought no one could make a cappuccino as well as Coffeehouse Northwest...Barista can.  This is an excellent coffee shop and the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  I have had espresso, cappuccino, and french press coffee here and all have been excellent.  The space itself is nice and open and also has an outdoor seating option.  Go to Coffeehouse NW if you want a more casual feel (and a younger crowd), go here if you're in The Pearl and want a great cup of coffee.","1804":"First time here and it was a wonderful experience! We arrived and the first thing I noticed was how clean\/nice the restaurant was. The servers were all very attentive and friendly. They served us mini sorbets before dinner and they were delicious! I had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was so good! Even the way the food was presented on the plate was so nice. I will definitely bring my friends and family here again.","1805":"This is a good lunch spot if you're in a hurry and want to avoid fast food. They really play up the organic\/hormone-free chicken hype to create the appearance of a healthy eatery. While they are probably a much healthier choice than a greasy burger, do keep in mind that much of the food is fried and loaded with sugar and salt. \nAs far as taste, most of the food I've tried leaves a lot to be desired by the Udon was actually good.\n\nThis is a pan Asian restaurant so authenticity is, noticeably, not a priority.","1806":"Really impressed! Food was excellent! All sorts of authentic flavors hit my tongue. A conglomerates of spices and textures done right. And the portions were gigantic. And for such an unassuming place. It's a hidden gem! Prices were great too! So was service! Definitely bringing my friends back!","1807":"We stayed here recently as a kick- off to our Oregon coastal road trip. \n\n2 nights showed me there is a wide range in level of service here. Our check in person was great- friendly & efficient. Next day? Different lady could hardly be bothered to help me. \n\nBack to the plus - we found the food here to be quite good. Stephanie , our breakfast hostess, was wonderful. Room service one night - we were pleasantly surprised by the prices & the quality of the food.\n\nThe room itself was a mixed bag. Very clean and we were facing the back, so it was quiet. The bed? Ugh. Memory foam topper on top of what is supposed to be a select comfort mattress. First off, we hate memory foam. Then, couldn't seem to get the mattress to adjust at all. Not comfortable sleeping for us.\n\nAlso, we couldn't get the AC \/ heating adjusted correctly. It would shut off at night & get very stuffy. The controls are older , in a console by the window instead of being controlled by a thermostat like many more updated Garden Inns.\n\nWe used points to stay here so it was fine for us. If you're paying cash, make sure you get a good deal!!","1808":"When you go to Disney World's parks, you expect Mickey Pretzels, Ice Cream Bars, and Chicken Tenders. What you don't expect, is high end African fusion cuisine in the middle of Animal Kingdom.\n\nI dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.\n\nI ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. \n\nThe first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.\n\nThe main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!\n\nFinally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.\n\nThe sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you receive a postcard collectible of an original drawing tributed to the AK. I love this restaurant, I love the food, and I love the service. Do yourself a favor and find some time to escape the jungle of the theme park and enjoy a fantastic meal at Tiffin's.","1809":"I just finished a 90 minute session with Elaine. I love this place! I've been coming here sporadically for two years. \n\nShe is very skilled and attentive and I always feel better afterwards. She always asks me what is going on for me physically and mentally, checks my hands and feet for temperature, looks at my tongue, etc. \n\nThe session involves both front and back acupuncture, with heat application, as well as a cupping session on my back, and some massage. \n\nThis is by far my preferred \"preventative\/balance\" body work when compared to straight massage, etc. (Obviously sports medicine\/physiotherapy are different realms.)\n\nGreat value, and she's super nice. I will return again and again.\n\n(Her service is also eligible for most company health benefit plans. Check your coverage!)","1810":"There are few things in life better then a good old fashioned hotdog, and that's exactly what you get at Casey's. \n\nSeating is limited to just counter space and a couple of small tables outside, with parking just as cramped. There is a takeout window on the side, which I typically order from and just eat in my car or sitting on the curb. Hotdogs are extremely inexpensive (~$2 with toppings), boil cooked, and tasty. There is no bend or squish to them, just a nice hard snap. Buns are just the way I like them, soft and moist. Toppings (ketchup, relish, etc) seem out of a can, but still quality goods. Orders usually take no more then a minute or two, and the staff is friendly as you'll find.\n\nThey aren't the best dogs I've had before, but certainly some of the better, and for the price, you really can't beat them. I believe they do serve some other items, but all I've ever had are the dogs, and never had a complaint. Certainly recommend if you're in the area or just have a craving.","1811":"I rented a car for 2 weeks while my car was being repaired. The driver picked me up at the mechanic and on our way back to get the rental car he drove over a curb! The car they gave me had a caution light on. I needed to return it in 4 days because the windshield wipers didn't work and it was raining out. They gave me another car with a caution light warning that something needed to be done with the car. Three days later another caution light went on and I needed to return the car. The newest car was filthy inside. I would need to clean the entire inside since it was covered in pollen. I immediately returned it to get another car that smelled like smoke. Wow!! Take care of your cars and have respect for your customers. Give them a CLEAN CAR! Take the time to clean the windshield as if you were going to be driving it!!!","1812":"Excellent spicy sausage pizza. Chicken Parmesan sliders were a great appetizer.","1813":"The food was good. They didn't have pitchers for beer. That was a bummer. The service was pretty good. The atmosphere was a little different than what I expected. It was quiet as hell in the bar even though college football was on. That shocked me. Maybe it's louder on NFL game days.","1814":"Went for a dinner with a good pal, who loves this place.\n\nOn a slow night, service was a bit odd, in that we had three servers during our meal. We had the grilled lamb, which was good, but not spectacular. The sides were good, the booth comfy to sit in, lots of variety on the menu. \n\nAfghan Horseman is just not my taste in decor. I felt as if I should be enjoying the \"experience\" rather than being presented with startlingly good food. Everything seemed a bit shabby. But that's my taste - concept restaurants are not my favourite.\n\nThe rice pudding was wonderful.","1815":"Pricey, but the spinach calzone is to die for!!! My kids also love the cheese pizza and can we just talk about the salad dressing the use in the Greek salad!?! OMG - if they bottles it I would buy it by the gallon. Soooooooo good!","1816":"I found this place on Yelp and stopped in after two hard days of soccer coaches camp on my way to Logan airport. I had pain everywhere and a lingering injury to my lower back. \n\nI have been getting body work done for about 20 years and this was among the best massages, if not the best, I have ever had. When the therapist climbed onto the table and drove her knees into my back it was like nothing I have ever experienced.\n\nYes, it is a little different from a traditional massage in the US. The style is clearly less inhibited. Instead of being buried in blankets and exposing bits and pieces of the body to work on, the therapist uses a fairly small towel to cover just enough of the body for modesty purposes.\n\nHowever, the results were amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the technique and felt fantastic when I walked out. I thought the $60 up front for 60 minutes was a great deal and I tipped $20 to show my appreciation.\n\nIf you are a prude, you might not like it. If you are comfortable with your body and like to be worked on in unusual ways (ex., tummy rub) this is the place for you!","1817":"I've often scoffed at the hyperbolic hear-say surrounding Veracruz, but elected to give them a call this morning during a work break for a breakfast taco. I was placed on hold for twelve minutes. Being sassy and white, I showed them the phone upon my arrival, still on hold, and ordered at the window. They apologized. After eating my taco: I would be placed on hold at a pay phone in a hailstorm until there's a female president to eat that again. Go to here. I apologized.","1818":"Fabulous wine flights, great service, divine cheese plates, and chocolate fondue to finish a perfect dinner with friends :)","1819":"As a Vancouver native, I have gone to this bagel shop since I was little. The new location is a great refresh and finally matches the level of quality that goes into their bagels and drinks! I frequent this shop at least once or twice a month and have only ever had speedy, happy service. \nAs for the bagels, they have a vast selection of bagels and cream cheeses... My favourite thing to get is the Greek Eggel, perfect if you want a savory breakfast. I don't know why there are a couple sour reviews on here, I love the place, they do bagels like no other!","1820":"The hotel in itself is very nice, both in decor and accomodations. Additionally, it is located in a desirable area (at least to my standards) as there are many places to dine and establishments to shop. The hotel room was very cozy.\n\nHowever, as I've said before, I am keen on customer service. Check-in was a breeze but I noticed some discrepencies in service that had me raising a brow. Another petpeeve of mine is when I give someone a card or cash in their hand and they place the money\/card on the counter... grinds my gears everytime. Especially when I have my hand out in a position to receive the item and Sam, who was assisting me at the moment looked me in my face, at my hand and chose to disregard it, place the change from my purchase on the counter and slide it toward me. Let's just say that he is lucky that I was feeling under the weather because if not, I would have made a gargantuan deal out of it. Trust me. When I spend my hard earned money, I expect to be treated with respect and fairly. If not, whomever is in charge is bound to hear from me.","1821":"Came here for valentine's day since it was one of the few places open super late.\n\nService here was great but the food didn't really do justice for me personally. \n\nOrdered:\nmiso soup- Always a must that complements any sushi\n\nsalmon wonton chips- There wasn't much or any spicy mayo on it. Not as good as I thought and hoped for.\n\n(sushi) hokkai yaki maki- Warm sushi, if you're into that. But it wasn't anything I'd want to order again\n\nscorpion maki- definitely won compared to the other maki roll, but also would rather try new rolls next time I visit.","1822":"A friend of mine gave me the \"newbie's tour\" of Desta last night.  Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.\n\nMy friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.\n\nIf you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat \"family style\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.\n\nThe Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \"perfect\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \n\nThe Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)\n\nAnyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  \n\nThere was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \n\nMy favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.\n\n(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)\n\nWith all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.\n\nMy experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\n\nOh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win.","1823":"Fabulous place! Lit only with strings of Christmas lights and colored light bulbs, a variety of seating configurations from pub tables to booths to couches, cool local art on the walls, and a great menu. The DJ was great - began his set with Duran Duran's The Chauffeur - doesn't get much cooler than that! He (she?) played a fantastic variety of music and some people were dancing with wild abandon. The bartender Carrie (sp?) is fantastic. Super sweet and fun, interacted with people like she actually cared they were there, made delicious drinks and just provided top notch service all around. My girls and I decided that this is our Friday night standing date place!","1824":"So what is a \"Hopdoddy\" you ask, well on their main page of their web site it goes a little something like this...  \n\nHopdoddy was created to express the perfect union of burgers and beer: Handcrafted Beer (Hop) + (Doddy), the nickname was given to the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nAnd there you have it, simple and sweet, but make no mistake this place is not so simple but yet the employee's are sweet and very hard working. Everyone from the greeter standing outside in the rain (yes it started to sprinkle) making sure everyone had a menu and answered any questions that were asked. She even handed out some umbrella to customers who were in line but forgot to bring one!\n\nYes, on some days (mostly weekends) you will be standing in some form of a line to get in and then to order. They only let in so many people at a time as this place is a seat yourself  burger bar. \n\nBecause ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. \n\nAs we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.\n\nOne of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.\n\nWe finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.\n\n-Magic Shroom Burger with a gluten free bun, Angus Beef, Texas Goat Cheese, Field Mushrooms, Mayo & Basil Pesto.\n\n-Shared some fries y Chile con Queso.\n\nWe got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! \n\nMy shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.\nThis burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.\nOne bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! \n\nThe fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!\n\nIt was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram! I really like when companies interact with their customers! \n\nThree cheers for semi healthy burgers in Austin!!","1825":"Matoi has become our favourite, go-to sushi restaurant in the Tri-cities area. It's usually decently busy but not where there is a wait (unless you have a bigger group). We've always found the service to be attentive and prompt -\u0412\u00a0tea refills, they give free pocky at the end too!\n\nFood wise, we almost always order a couple of the same items -\u0412\u00a0chicken karaage don, negitoro roll, unagi roll, and best of all the black cod (gindara). If you come at lunch you can get a good value lunch set with the gindara that comes with rice, a pickled side dish and miso soup. The black cod melts in your mouth!\n\nLast but not least, I believe it's an authentic Japanese restaurant -\u0412\u00a0even a lot of the servers are Japanese.","1826":"Like everyone else, I went to The Eye Studio because of all of the wonderful Yelp reviews.  Plus, it was close to work, and I'm a sucker for convenience.\n\nI went to Dr. Tsai for about 18 months for a dry eye situation that I notice the most when I wake up around 3 a.m.  She had me wear my contacts less and less, go on steroid drops, Omega 3 pills, twice daily eyelid washes, warm eye compresses and what I felt were rather regular appointments.  None of it helped.  I still wake up in the middle of the night with eyes that feel like sandpaper.  \n\nIt was the same every appointment.  I'd explain what I was experiencing to Dr. Tsai.  She'd tell me that my dry eyes were related to wearing contacts.  I'd share the fact that I first noticed the dry eye problem when I wore contacts once or twice a year - usually for weddings.  She'd recommend that I wear my contacts less.\n\nThis happened three or four times until I realized that Dr. Tsai wasn't actually listening to me.  She had committed to a specific course of treatment, and there was nothing I could say to change it.\n\nTwo weeks later I went in for my annual eye exam.\n\nAfter the exam, Dr. Tsai launched into a lecture all about the long-term ramifications of dry eye, and how I needed to address my condition - soon.  I had to stop her midsentence and ask if the issue was really that much worse than two weeks earlier when she told me that it was manageable.  That's when I realized something.\n\nShe hadn't bothered to read my patient file before the exam. \n\nI get it.  She sees lots of other patients.  I could have been any one of the hundreds, which is why I have a patient file that holds the details specific to me and my desert like eyes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I continued to work with Dr. Tsai and her staff while trying to find a new contact lense brand.  On the surface they give the impression that they want to help, but it resulted in a snarky e-mail from a patient care coordinator and the longest two months of my life.  \n\nThat's right - option one was a bust and not even the brand I had requested.  It took them over a week to even order option two.  Then Dr. Tsai tried to feed me a line about how it could take my eyes over two weeks to adjust to a new prescription. \n\nIt turned out that I didn't need to work through the headaches while my eyes adjusted.  The contacts had been ordered with the wrong prescription - specifically the wrong axis.  \n\nDr. Tsai gave me a song and dance about how each contact brand is different from the last.  She told me not to worry. We'd keep at it until we found the right pair.\n\nBy my next appointment, she had ordered the right axis for option two and ordered a third brand.  Neither of which worked for me.  Then she told me that we could continue to work on this, but I'd need to pay another contact fitting fee of close to $100.\n\nYes, I'm demanding.  If I'm wearing corrective lenses, I'd like to see clearly.  Yes, she ordered four pairs of contacts for me - three different brands.  I had specifically asked for one brand, but it wasn't ordered until option two.  At that point, someone ordered the wrong prescription.  \n\nI will only take responsibility for two pairs of contacts.  The other two are squarely on Dr. Tsai and her staff.\n \nAfter all of this, I still don't have a current contact prescription.  And, I'm officially done with The Eye Studio.","1827":"I found this place to be a little pompous. The food is pretty good, but the attitude is not. The crowd seems to be the type that aren't really interested in anything other than themselves. If your looking for a nice place to have a cocktail with a few friends, then this place is fine. A very gay friendly venue.","1828":"I visited this coffee shop while I was out and about. They have a front and back entrance, which leads to a parking lot. They offer almond milk (huge plus for me) and lots of flavor shots to choose from. Staff complimented my glass straws a few months ago, and I recently found out they now offer them in the store. I really appreciate that they are moving to being more environmentally friendly. Unfortunately every time I ask for no straws they still place them in the cup, defeating the purpose of me bringing in my own straw.","1829":"I was really disappointed with this place. I had expected better! The karaoke is extremely loud and wasn't enjoyable. You basically pay the cover to hear crappy music. If you want to go upstairs you have to pay another cover. The music upstairs had a throwback kind of feel. The drinks were cheap but there wasn't anything special about them. I ordered a scorpion bowl to share as everyone else did and it was alright. The highlight of the night was the  $1 chicken skewers brought by the \"chicken man\". If you're drunk, they taste great but now that I am sober I don't think I would eat those again considering he walks around with a bowl of chicken and walks around the place.","1830":"I have been a customer at this Bertuccis for a long time and the new restaurant is great. The changes to the menu are fantastic. There is a blonde manager there who has really changed the place around from what it was. She treats everyone like family including the staff and you can tell that they really want to be there. I highly recommend this restaurant!","1831":"Really disappointed here when I dropped by for lunch. Looking back I don't think there is one positive thing I can say about this place based upon my experience.\n\nIt went south right away when we found ourselves waiting five minutes at the hostess stand to be seated. When she finally did appear, there was no apology or explanation offered. The place looked to be about half full but perhaps they were short staffed?\n\nWe did get our drinks ordered and delivered quickly (ok one good thing) but from there it took 50 minutes for us to get our food ordered and out from the kitchen. I went with the sliders and my table mates both got the grouper sandwich. \n\nMy sliders arrived luke warm at best, had stale buns, were overcooked and lack any flavor. As a side, I picked homemade chips that were cold, not crispy and again not really tasty. At this point, we were late to get back from lunch or I would have sent everything back. \n\nService was spotty throughout with my water glass going empty on two occasions and no real feedback on why things were so slow.\n\nSorry to say you can do much better than here and this will be a land soon forgotten.","1832":"Has this place deteriorated? I've gone twice in the last few weeks and both times they have been out of the Scali bread for the sandwiches and a few weeks ago they had run out of ketchup (yes ketchup). Seriously, have an employee run over to Shaws and grab some ketchup. The pizza has also been undercooked lately though it's good if you ask for it well-done. However my husband and I have been so disappointed the last few times we've gone (we actually cancelled our order tonight because again they were out of the bread), that I'm dropping a star.","1833":"Terrible customer service. We ordered 18 wings on a Tuesday night. After waiting an hour and a half we called the store and the manager said that the delivery was almost to our house and that he'd give us a $5 off coupon for THE NEXT ORDER. After another 20 minutes, we got a call from the delivery guy asking for directions to our house because he couldn't find it on GPS. We've ordered wings multiple times from local restaurants and have never had trouble like this. I called to find out where our driver was again...then was hung up on. We're at the 2 hour mark and we still haven't gotten a delivery- I'll never order from this company again.  The fact that a \"$5 off next order\" coupon was offered was a joke. There's no way they're getting my business again.","1834":"Popped into Eastside Mario's on Thanksgiving Sunday with my boyfriend Rob and our friends Michelle and Jenn. We'd been poking around Lonsdale market and just wanted somewhere nice and chill to sit, eat and hopefully catch some rays with this lovely weather we've been having. Mario's may look a little 'commercialised' with all the 'Italian Grandma' (or should I say Nona) decor but I found it to be really cute and cosy. \n\nThe servers are friendly too (I was delighted to hear the English accent of one of the waiters as he busied to and fro - a little slice of home!) and very attentive. Our server was really sweet and friendly without coming off like a pest - she was very good at gauging when we needed something like a drink or an appy. \n\nMy friends have varying tastes in food and Rob is just plain fussy, but we were able to find something that suited all our palettes. I had the Ceasar Salad Piadini off the lunch menu which was really fresh and filling too, for a salad. \n\nThe sangria here is soooo nice, I had two and think I may have drank them too quickly as they were so good! Rob had the traditional burger - lovely juicy patty on a soft bun with home fries and fresh salad - who can argue with that? Jenn and Michelle shared a platter of crispy fried goodies. All in all, super happy and the spot on the balcony we were on was perfect! \n\nWe'll be here for a few more days at least so I wouldn't rule out popping in again :)","1835":"Calamari was over cooked.  The pizza for $11 was a disappointment to say the least.","1836":"Drinks are expensive, not worth the free ticket for the country concert my gf and I went to.  I also left my fitbit there, called their messaging service two different times and never received a call back as I was told I would receive.  very poor customer service.","1837":"The only nail place to go to. Andy n Rosie are the best. Love them. Come check them out!","1838":"Good but too expensive for my taste.  I choose Coco donuts.","1839":"My family and I are big Thomas Haas and Ganache Patisserie fans, and I wanted to get cakes to celebrate an occasion with my family, but since both were already closing, I ended up going to Thierry. Boy, that ended up being a great choice as we liked the different chocolate cake slices that we got here a bit more than the other 2 places. The chocolate was very high quality and the cakes emphasized the chocolate taste. I'm definitely coming back.","1840":"We had breakfast here, and for the price, was expecting much more. The Eggs Benedict was delicious, but the Avocado Toast was a slight disappointment. The $20 dish is definitely excessive for what it was. While the goat cheese was a nice addition, there was barely any avocado on the piece of bread. \n\nOur food came out pretty fast, and service was very good. It is a good option for hotel guests.","1841":"Great service.  Also offers a 10% discount to students.","1842":"Small little place but extremely friendly staff, delicious poutine, sandwich and dips for the fries.","1843":"I had been to Finz this summer with my brothers and had the most amazing salmon dish. I'm talking drool worthy best-meal-I've-ever-had dish. So when it came time for my 30th birthday dinner that's obviously what I wanted. I'd literally been dreaming about this salmon! If I were to base this review on that experience it'd be a 5 star, hands down.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive but things came out horribly slow. We got apps and drinks and were done with our appetizers and waited at least 10-15 more minutes before our meals came out. Slow to the point where I thought maybe our meals had been forgotten about. I ordered another drink and by the time I got it I didn't want it anymore slow.\n\nThe food came out and it didn't look quite as I remembered. It didn't taste quite as I remembered. In fact, it was pretty disappointing. \n\nMaybe it was because they had a rehearsal dinner going on, but I was not satisfied at all.  The service was slow, the food was disappointing, the overall experience just left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). It was really too bad because I had talked this place up to everyone and I left crestfallen.","1844":"My fav pizza in Columbus hands down! It doesn't get better than their selection of sauce, crust, and toppings.\n\nFor something fun and delicious I recommend this combination. Get yourself a Smokin' Joe's with Howlin Hot sauce.. throw a few meats on there too. Then order their nacho's (you wont be disappointed). In my experience the pizza comes shortly after the nachos so what you do is take the left over nachos and dump them on the pizza. \n\nYou are welcome! \n\nUpdate: I have recently spoken with people who complain about the service and how everyone is rude. I simply don't see it. I eat here probably 3-4 times a month and half dine in and half carry out. I have never had a bad experience with service. Perhaps some people are asking too much of a pizza joint? If they are looking for some fine dinning experience they can walk down the street to Harvest.","1845":"Carlucci's is a very average Italian restaurant.  I had Eggplant Parmesan and some appetizers - garlic rolls and pizza rolls.  None of it was bad, but nothing to rave about either.  My best impression was the fact that they had a number of craft beers in bottle - Victory Hop Devil (IPA) and Pennant Ale '55 (English Pale Ale) included - along with the standard Italian mainstay Peroni.  Knowing that I'll probably have to settle for the latter is always a downside of eating Italian for me.","1846":"emailed them on a Friday night at 10 pm. answered within a hour. Daughter was in from out of town with a cracked i phone screen. Saturday morning was in and out in 30 minutes with the phone repaired. Fantastic, Brilliant service!!!! Don't go anywhere else . I've been to others over the years and trust me ,, don't go anywhere else","1847":"Discovered this Mexican cart in the new food carts at 43rd & SE Belmont (across the street from the old food carts). The woman and man inside were both super nice and accommodating.  I had the mushroom burrito in a bowl ($6.50) and they were able to sub black beans for the usual pinto beans. The bowl is generous (even includes guacamole) and more than enough for a full meal. It was really fresh and flavorful. I'll definitely be back.","1848":"The stars are for the tasty, not the presentation.  I've had cakes from here several times and when they say \"do you want decorations on it?\" they mean curly ribbons on the edges, which seems a little weird to me.  But people who aren't even cake fans adore their cakes so they must be doing something right!\n\nAs for the coffee, it can be hit or miss.  Seating is functional, not pretty.  Not the best coffeeshop to park yourself for the afternoon but it's in a plaza with plentiful parking so it's the perfect place to get coffee to go.","1849":"Really good, but not worth the wait. \n\nMedina has a couple of must tries - the waffles, the cassoulet, and the tagine. Quality and ambiance is top notch, and the prices are fair.\n\nHowever, the one knock - and it's a big one - is that the lines are simply too long and they aren't necessarily justified. \n\nMedina is good, but is it the best brunch spot in Vancouver? Not at all. It doesn't make sense to wait an hour for a \"pretty good\" brunch.","1850":"My best friend was in town and we decided to try this cafe because there are great reviews. It wasn't busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up, and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two. She told us that if we sit at the bar, the food is 20% off and when we nodded, she said \"seat yourself\" in a rude and unwelcoming manner. She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange. \n\nWe found seats at the bar, and the bartender was nice to us, although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it. I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. \n\nAfter waiting, she finally said \"I'll be right with you.\" \nIt took her another 5 minutes to be \"right with us.\" She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. \n\nThe food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude. I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service. \n\nWould I recommend this place to anyone? Not at all. \n\n*** my friend is also a waitress, so we were being generous with our expectations and even with our tip.***","1851":"Just called to get a price quote and talk about unfriendly. I'm sorry am I bothering you by asking questions? I told her no thank you I could tell by her unfriendly and put out attitude that I wanted nothing to do with them.","1852":"Expensive pizza that's not very good. Better options nearby.\n\nOne large pizza was almost $18. The dough they use is very airy, maybe it's just personal preference but it's way too light, so not only is it expensive but it doesn't even fill you up. My BBQ chic pizza was also light on the toppings. For $14 you can get a way better pizza down the street at Johnnie's.","1853":"Nice place for taking the family to the movies. Nothing fancy, but still comfortable.  Inexpensive tickets and treats. They are remodeling the bathrooms so it can be a long wait if you need to use it.  In general it was a nice experience.","1854":"Super noisy in the afternoon, all the inconsiderate kids come in after school and scream and yell and horse around.  I feel bad for the employees because there is nothing they can do to stop it.  That's when all the adults that actually spend money there get up and leave.   There are better local coffee shops in Marblehead without the chaos.","1855":"Fantastic! Went here for happy hour. I like happy hours at these types of restaurants because it allows use to try multiple types of food at reasonable rates. We tried oysters Rockefeller and these were way better than Trulucks and we like Trulucks. Lollipop Lamb Chops, I did not care for these because they did not have much flavor. On the positive side they were extremely tender! Asian fillet Mignon was outstanding. Carpetbagger appetizer was incredible. Tender and flavorful.\nAhi Tuna tartar was outstanding. Great flavor super fresh. Chilled gulf shrimp was good, large and fresh. \nDrinks: Cosmo was not that great, lot of liquor but missed the flavor. Bulleit Sour was great. Maverick and Sparkling Ruby were spot on. \nOur bill was $127 without tip. Great price. Great flavor. Great service. We will be back for sure. \nAlmost forgot bananas flambe was really good. Looking forward to our next visit.","1856":"This has never been my ideal spot to get ice cream but it's most confident due to where I work. Anyways, every time I go in I get attitude from the workers. However the most recent trip in proved it could get worse. We were served by a worker who started about a month or so ago, I have seen her a few times but never been helped by her. She would always run to the back as soon as customers came in. But this time when the other workers were busy and she had to step forward and actually do customer service like her job describes, she did a very poor job of it. She said her name is Hannah. She has blue hair, a lip ring, and gauged ears if that helps describe her. She was rather soft spoken and when I asked her to speak up a bit so I could hear better she suddenly gave me attitude at my request. So the whole process of dishing up my ice cream was far from pleasant. I then proceeded to ask a question regarding other workers and she snapped at me to \"JUST HAVE A GOOD DAY\" and stormed off to the back. Extremely rude. Apparently she has done something similar to a friend's friend of mine. She seems to have the lack of decent people skills, and lack of work effort. I am sorry but people who act like this should not be working in a place that caters to customers directly. Personally I do not see how she got this job as she is rude and unprofessional.","1857":"Had the passion fruit mimosas and vegetarian  patacon. I really enjoyed my drinks and food. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely recommend it!!","1858":"93 Health Score - Thumbs Up!\n\nThe Hostess and 1 of the waitresses (which actually later turned out to be our waitress), couldn't have cared less about our arrival and weren't quite dismissive, but there was DEFINITELY a \"Whatever Aloof Attitude\" going on.\n\nThe look and feel of the place was kool, modern, bar, with nice, spacious, cushy, white upholstered booths and modern minimalist tables, with a few TV's behind the bar showing the French Open.\n\nThe Falafel Burger and the Roasted Cauliflower were strictly SMOKIN' and well worth the trip.  \n\nOnce our waitress was away from the front entrance, she was actually very attentive, welcoming, helpful and warm...No harm, no foul! =)\n\nJust because of location, I won't be a regular, but if you're a gourmet burger fan I'd suggest a visit and I'll definitely stop by again...","1859":"Always pleasant. Professional. And speedy. \nHave my mailbox here too and it's a great service and package. \nDont see me leaving here anytime soon","1860":"This place is so freaking hit and miss.  I guess that is what you get though when the sub shop is being run by a bunch of stoned college kids.  Example, yesterday...went there with two friends to grab a \"quick bite.\"  I order first, pay, then sit down.  My two buddies order after me.  They get their sandwiches, and I don't get mine.  10 minutes pass...  After 15 minutes I ask someone who works there and they say it should be right out.  After 20 minutes I go to the counter and ask for a refund.  Turns out they haven't even started making the sandwich and the crappy-ass counter girl who looked 12 years old wouldn't give me a refund.  I finally get the manager out and he refunds my money and has the gall to ask me if he should cancel the sandwich order.  \"No jack off,  I want my damn sandwich!\"   5 minutes later they gave me my sandwich.  I sat down at the table (my friends were already done eating), ate my sandwich and it was great.  \n\nSandwich = good  \nService = Stoners who don't know how to handle \"their highs\"\n\nI would also like to point out that my buddy ordered a BLT and was shocked at how much bacon was actually on the sandwich.  He literally had to pull out strips of bacon because it was too much.  These guys definitely pile on the ingredients. \nSo here is the new recap:\n\nPortions = Beyond Huge\nSandwich = Good\nService = Stoners who don't know how to handle \"their highs\"","1861":"Club 205 is, you guessed it, right off the 205. Things that this place has going for them: $8.95 prime rib, $6.95 burgers, no cover, and cheap drinks. The girls are better looking on average, but honestly, that's not saying much. A missing tooth here a bad boob job there. \n\nThe Private Room is anything but that. You (or someone else) can purchase a dance, but everyone can see into the \"private room\". Depending on who you get, this could be worth it, but remember, no touching!\n\nThe claim to fame is that they have put the Hooters across the street out of business. Hopefully the girls from Hooters didn't have a tough time getting jobs at Club 205, it's the least they could have done.","1862":"Best breakfast in Boulder!! Love the feel of the place, our server was great, and the food was delicious. It's always busy though, so be prepared to wait. You can go walk along Pearl st. to kill the time","1863":"Excellent ambience and extremely delicious food. Service could improve on terms of speed.","1864":"Great place to kick back with a happy hour martini (dirty martini is a special favorite). Love the calamari appetizer. Good fish and chips.","1865":"Went here for dinner in day two of our trip. It was recommended by a few people in the Denver area. It was awesome! We sat at the bar and explained to the bartender we were there on our anniversary trip. He gave us each a free glass of champagne with a strawberry! I wish I could remember his name! He suggested Poulet en Brique for my wife and it was delicious! The chicken had so much flavor and so tender! She loved it and so did I. I had the steak frites and it was great. The meat was ordered medium well and came out a little more on the medium side. It was still delicious and full of flavor! When we go back were definitely coming back to this place. Once I remember the bartenders name I'll make sure to post it. He was the only guy behind the bar on March 27th when we went! Didn't catch their happy hour but will make sure to catch it next time!","1866":"I love that this place is within walking distance of my home, and will admit that their pastelitos de queso (aka quesitos) are awesome when you get them fresh in the morning.  But Other than that this place is kind of \"blah.\"  Their Cuban Coffe is NOT espresso, and when you order it it is poured from a large coffee pot behind the counter, and not made fresh! \n\nTheir Croquettes taste good, but don't really taste home-made as you would hope at a bakery  (I think they are frozen and fried on demand)!  And the Ropa vieja I once ordered tasted like it was scraped from the bottom of the pot...and tasted charred.  Their sandwiches are tasty, and their chicken soup will fix you up when you're sick.  \n\nThis place isn't horrible, but it most certainly isn't great or authentic Cuban for that matter....They serve mofongo and arroz con gandules...geez.  Try Pancho's down the street, or Sedano's for real Cuban food.  If you just want pastries and American style coffee...than this place is great for a quick stop.","1867":"In town on business for the week and I was getting really sick of going out to restaurants and having to pick from the one or two vegetarian\/vegan options they had on the menu. Finally made my escape and was able to find this gem. Good grief! Absolutely delicious food. Definitely one of the top 3 vegan dishes I've had. \nSo much selection, very fresh ingredients and an awesome environment. Music was great too. \nNever thought I'd look forward to another business trip - I'll be back!","1868":"Waitress wonderful personality, but service was slow. Ordered blackened mahi sandwich which had absolutely no taste the fries had more taste than fish. The other guests with me were also unhappy with their food. Nice atmosphere, but expensive for quality of food. Will not return","1869":"Table of 7\nBeer selection: 5\/5 \nThey have a good selection on tap, and they do half liters, liters, and boots. Can't go wrong \nService: 4\/5 \nI've heard this place can have bad service but I guess we got lucky.\nFood: 3.5\/5\nGerman pretzel, unfortunately, not good. Way way way too salty, not like it is in Germany. I would rather eat the one in Germany ice cold with no side than this one warm with cheese. \nSausages were delicious, and potato dumpling wasn't the best I've had but definitely tasty. \nI will try other selections next time I go. \nPrice: 4\/5 \nTypical German restaurant prices, but I am glad their beers aren't overpriced. Went to a German restaurant that charged 7.50 for a half liter of warsteiner, now that's ridiculous. This place doesn't do that. You get a whole liter for $11. \n\nTheir live music brought me back to Germany. Their long tables are just like an authentic German Biergarten and the music reminded me of Oktoberfest. The place is much bigger than you'd expect. \nOverall I would definitely come back. This place is perfect for large parties and celebrations. Definitely a lot of fun. Hopefully the rest of the food brings my rating up to 5\/5.","1870":"Over priced pretentious food....waiter actually stood at our table and read the menu to us.....uh, ok...thanks but we can read. Waste of time and money.","1871":"What has happened here?   ARROGANT, almost dismissive owner and hostess.   Service was matter of fact.   Food was much better on previous 5 or 6 visits but acceptable.    I think its time to hyper-freshen or just  retire this no-longer-Nuevo factory.     Not going to wait for an attitude adjustment in this restaurant buzzing city.    No longer on my recommendation list.","1872":"This is the best place to get your ears lowered! They don't take take credit card and a cut is $15 so be prepared. These guys use the old straight razor and make sure you don't walk out with hair on your shirt. Do your dignity a favor and skip the strip mall hair salons and let these guys take care of you.","1873":"If I could give 0 stars, i would. The only IPA they have is nitro only. This would be great if I liked flat beer. We keep trying to like this place, but had to walk out before we could even think about ordering food because the beer is so pathetic. Please, Westerville, realize that people like IPA.","1874":"So loud! Nice staff. Mediocre food. Overpriced. Won't go back. So much better food in the Easton area.","1875":"Everything here is good-- the burgers, the fries (especially the truffle fries), the milkshakes, and the atmosphere. This is a great place to go with friends, and don't be intimidated by the line that snakes out the door -- there is great people watching to be done on South Congress!","1876":"I have done my hair with Johnny since 3 years ago and I just love him. he is the best hair color professional that I've met.  He understands exactly what I want and always makes me very satisfied with my hair color and also hair cut. Also I love his personality. He is calm, sweet and makes me trust him. He is very professional, friendly and efficient. I give him 5 stars.\nEvery time I go to Patrice Vinci I leave happy and relaxed. Thanks Johnny for being such a great professional and for making me feel so happy with my hair.","1877":"Sitting at the table as I writing this. It is Disney not known for there food but I'm just disgusted that they would charge the prices they do an not make an attempt to serve better food. It was frozen no taste  garbage.","1878":"Everyone knows Suzette makes good crepes, and it is hip and trendy and a great place to take your mom, friend from out of town, or freshen you up after a night of binge drinking, but Suzette also cares about their customers.\n\nI wanted a very special Mother's Day this year and that included a sh*t ton of crepes for my mom, family, and girlfriend's family.  Suzette gladly obliged.  Not only did they make us a yummy collection of to go crepes for the crew, but they blew my mind in how flexible and inexpensive the special order was.\n\nHighly recommend","1879":"Walked in with my boyfriend and waited to be seated. The restaurant was small enough that every server saw us walk in and ignored us. One server walked by us to bus a table and said nothing about whether or not someone would be able to help us. The bartender walked by and said nothing. Then all of the workers held a pow wow and glanced over at us and kept talking. In the corner, we saw a couple who had been sat ,with empty glasses and menus in front of them, looking around for their waiter. They had similar looks of frustration. Figured if we had this much trouble getting a table, we'd probably have as much trouble actually getting our order taken. Disappointed that I couldn't get my ramen fix in but luckily, Rain was a couple feet away and more than willing to seat and serve us in a reasonable amount of time.","1880":"Awesome place to visit on a lazy day! The UBC campus is like a small town and the Beaty is worth a visit","1881":"For price, selection, good house brands, and some exotic items, this is my weekly grocery store.  Fruits and vegetables are fresh.  Staffing\/checkout is good considering how many people go there on a Saturday.  Employees are helpful and friendly.  The secret to their low prices is volume, and they stock continuously during the day.  The down side is that it's usually crowded, hard to find a parking space in the huge lot, and stockers are taking up space for carts.  When the (non-unionized) employees shut the operation down to support their former and current CEO Artie T, I shop at other places (not crossing a picket line), and it made me realize that the value of MB is undeniable.","1882":"Bahn Mi, Pho, Vermicelli.  Not great service, but a great choice for Pho if you're in that neck of the woods.","1883":"I wanted to give a yelp out to James Allan Salon for hosting Cuts for the Cause on Sunday, August 17. I'd never been to one of these but I needed a haircut so I figured I'd give it a shot. The email I received said stylists from James Allan would be there alond with stylists from Bob Salon. \n\nThey were busy when I arrived and the atmosphere was fun. There were lots of couples with babies and families coming in for cuts. I signed in and they said the wait would be about 25 minutes. They had lots of free food...delicious chocolate cake, cookies, tacos from Zocalo, cheese and crackers. There were reps from Trinity Center, a resource center for the homeless. \n\nPeople were wandering around with wet hair and I realized Cuts for the Cause is all about volume (unintended hair pun). They just wash and cut, there is no blow dry\/styling. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes, I was hooked up with a stylist who works at the salon. As for the cut, well, it's not the best cut I've had but it's not the worst. The person who cut my hair was nice enough and seemed competent but there was no chance for her to check the cut after it was dry and tweak as necessary. So this morning I got out the fabric scissors and trimmed some straggly ends. \n\nThey get four stars for donating their time and energy on a day when salons aren't usually open. If I was just rating the haircut, I'd give them a three.","1884":"I have been to the 4 Rivers in Ocoee several times. This one is new and,flavorful and  very close to our home. It is also new, opened this week.  We were there at 2:00 and there was a line but moved good. I asked for a sample of Burnt Ends as I have not had them before. The server gave me a plain sample and then added their BBQ sauce. Yippee. I do not like BBQ sauce but this was delicious. The meat was tender , juicy and flavorful. It was not tomatoey just a sweet sour savory taste. The okra was crisp yet tender.  The sweet potato casserole was very flavorful.  I do not like grits, but the cheesy grits were good.  It was a   delicious experience.","1885":"I needed a uhaul the week of my move, and found this location not far from my current apartment.  It sits off the 85 access road, and can be a little challenging to get too if you are taking 85 South (challenging bc you have to cross 3 lanes of traffic on the access road to turn in).\n\nI booked my time for a 9am pickup on Sunday online and requested a dolly and moving blankets.  I ended up getting there around 8:50ish, and they already were open, which was awesome!  \n\nI was checked in very fast, and had everything set to go.  It was a very smooth and easy process.  The guy also extended my time with the vehicle just in case.  I loaded up quickly and parked my car around the back (not much parking to leave your vehicle).\n\nI ended up returning the truck pretty quickly with my move, and total only came to $93 for the 17 foot truck plus paying for the gas I didn't refill.  FYI - the 17 foot truck is really only good for a 1 bedroom apartment.\n\nI had a great experience here, which certainly differs from what I read.  I'd use them again!","1886":"Got take out from here a while ago. I had the aloo gobi which is cauliflower and potatoes stewed in a tomatoey sauce. OMG it was so good. I've tried aloo gobi at a few other places but so far none have measured up to this place!","1887":"An American favorite lands in BC!\nI made the trek over to Carls Jr. on my lunch break with a few coworkers. I was kind of surprised at the space that they decided to use, as they lay out is rather, well... Awkward. It is a very thin room, but very lengthy - think Tunnel Nightclub, if you remember it. \n\nI had a guacamole burger and added jalape\u0413\u00b1os because I am crazy and love spice. I had literally inhaled half my burger before my coworkers had them unwrapped. The avocado in the guac was fresh and creamy, the burger was actually moist and cooker properly. Service as fairly quick and they bring your made-to-order burgers right to your table using the \"take this huge number on a stick\" system. Overall ... But it was the price that got me. $22 for two burgers, two fries and two pops? Gahhh. Don't get me wrong, the burgers were delicious, but not $22 delicious. Pop is pop and the fries were rather blah as well. \n\nGood for the \"experience\" but it won't be a frequent lunch haunt for me.","1888":"Not my first time here but it's definitely been awhile. I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the \"best Pho in Austin.\" I'm not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I don't remember.\nThe drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I don't know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I've only been here like 3 times). \nI guess I never noticed before because I've never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. \nThe flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. \nI actually didn't opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they didn't put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it's like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce\/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. \nIf I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.","1889":"Very consistent in quality and service! It's enjoyable to go out with loved one into this kind of establishment. Pricey, but that's what make an experience memorable.","1890":"I agree with Michelle C's review. The Dim Sum is more expensive than I'm used to paying, it is not as authentic as I'm used to eating and the selection isn't as broad as I would expect.\n\nHowever, if you're a girl like me who dreams of Har Gau (shrimp balls), wakes up craving Congee (rice soup) and for who eating Gai Mei Bao (coconut bun, chicken tail or cocktail bun) is forever linked to the memory of my dad taking us to the chinese bakery after our weekend lunches in Chinatown, this place is heaven.\n\nI went to Get Sum Dim Sum for lunch on Friday. It is a very casual restaurant. You order at the counter and they give you a number then bring you your food. This is perfect if you are eating alone, as I was. It is also perfect for take out, if you just need to grab something quick you can call ahead and then stop in to pick it up. It's would not be that quick or easy at a traditional dim sum restaurant with cart service. I ordered a la carte. My food was delicious, not exactly what I'm used to getting at a more traditional Chinese restaurant but still very yum. The combos they offer seem like a very good value if you want something off their top 10 menu.\n\nI've been thinking about going back every hour since I left. This place is definitely a mouth watering winner!","1891":"I went to Henri's Bakery with my younger brother for lunch while he was in town visiting. Believe it or not I had NO idea this place existed until just recently. Not, I've been missing out. Great place to meet a friend for lynch in Buckhead that's classy but on the cheap. \n\nDefinitely plan to return.","1892":"Went to Pet Supermarket yesterday to use an emailed coupon the corporation had sent me. (They send out a phenomenal newsletter usually monthly and often have great coupons in them for either $2 off of a $10 purchase or sometimes $5 off of a $25 purchase.) \n\nI knew this store had recently been renovated and was wanting to see what was new.  I have to say they did a great  job.  The store is beautiful and well organized, brightly lit and very clean. And the best thing.... the two young female employees were very helpful. \n\nThe other best change to me was there was actually prices on just about all of the merchandise!  This was always a problem with this store in the past as it seemed employees just mostly stood around even though a great many items had no prices. Bringing it to the attention of the employees made no difference. I am always annoyed when a store makes it a habit of not pricing their merchandise and cause customers to have to ask what the prices are on many items.  AND I don't think it is helpful when an employee says that I should feel free to ask like as if they are afraid I consider it an inconvenience for them!  I don't want to shop that way and they never seemed to get what an inconvenience it is to the customer to constantly have to bring items up to the register to find out the prices.  \n\nI hope this store continues to be well run. It is greatly improved!","1893":"Not a big fan of hibachi usually but this place was very good! I was able to get tofu as a choice hibachi style. Big portion sizes! The chef (Yuki) was genuinely funny and not just the generic script comedy some hibachi places provide. The manager came over to check on us a few times and he was also very nice and funny. Came as a visit I in the Orlando area so not sure if\/when I'll frequent again, but it's worth a visit for sure!!","1894":"Great place to end our tour of Salem on. It was freezing outside and this restaurant was an oasis of warmth, good seafood and yummy cocktails. The wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the days catch. Everything we orders was delicious- oysters, pizza, fried shrimp, lobster quesadillas and fried pickles. Only downside was the basket of lobster came out whole with no prior cuts or cracks and therefore was extremely difficult and messy to try and crack and eat.","1895":"I came here a few weeks ago for a steak dinner, the night before my wisdom teeth removal (a \"last supper\" of sorts!) \n\nFood is good. Especially the steak. Less saltier than the steak at Jules but equally as tender. The mustard butter was something I've never had before and would definitely recommend.\nOne of the specials of the night was a seafood pot with toasted crustini bread - we found this dish to be our least favourite of the night. \nThe French onion soup was hearty, a tad bit too runny, but packed full of flavour.\nThe featured mushroom tartes flambees was also good but not the type of tart I was expecting (imagine a sheet of puff pastry with toppings on a bed of salad, see pic below)\n\nService is a hit or miss, our empty plates sat at our table for a while before it was eventually cleared.","1896":"The tower is incredible. The shaded paths are lovely. The flowers are always in bloom in the spring. It's magical.","1897":"Lots of variety and interesting flavors and the donuts taste good! We arrived on a Monday around 10am and there was a line inside but it went by quickly. We ordered the Maple Bacon, Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, and Blueberry Basil. My favorite was the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, I really enjoyed the crunchy texture from the Chocolate Crunch. I definitely recommend if you're in town!","1898":"Pretty solid indian food. I always ask for delivery to UBC, and almost always ordered their butter chicken. The portion and quality is very good, and I (think) it is authentic butter chicken. The delivery process is straight forward and on time. Unlike other places, they can actually find the address that you told them to deliver the food.","1899":"The great thing about this place is that there is a high def TV at nearly every table.  That about covers the highlights though.\n\nThe food is average to slightly below average.  It is just very bland.  Nothing remotely stands out about it.  The service is lacking.  And you can't blame it on crowds b\/c when I did go there were only a few other tables being serviced, yet the wait staff was still terrible.  For having all the televisions and a promising atmosphere this place is just like it's food; VERY BLAND.  Not good, not bad.\n\nIf all the other sports bars are to crowded and you really want to see a game out somewhere than consider going here.  Otherwise there are to many better alternatives in town to be wasting your time at Daddy's Grill & Bar.","1900":"Always amazing food and service. Get the vegetable deluxe it is phenomenal. They are willing to work with you on your dietary needs. Been coming here for years and it never disappoints.","1901":"I've been here a couple of times, and it reminds me of the mechanic shop that I used to work for when I was in high school.  Not the ones where after looking at your car for hours they say you need parts that you don't want or can't afford, but honest hardworking mechanics who will fix your car the same day you bring it in.\n\nI recently had been towed in from the highway, and after a dreadful morning of breaking down on the highway, missing some of work, and dreading the damage done moneywise, I was surprised to hear that not only would my car be fixed within hours of dropping it off, but I could hold off on the more expensive services and they could keep track of them for a later date when I could be able to afford it.  I didn't get ripped off, I didn't get upsold something that was ridiculous, and I wasn't taken for a ride - I was served and on my way.  Definitely found my go-to place for car maintenance.","1902":"It's really nice a lot of food there has to be something for everyone best Chinese buffet in Orlando","1903":"Oh man! So good! Clean, quiet and delicious! Don't let the building fool you, it's amazing.","1904":"With PDX 671 recently moving to the Rose City Food Park on NE 52nd and Sandy, I figured it was time to re-visit this cart and have some tasty Guamanian food. Last time, I missed out on the Kelaguen Mannok, and I made certain not to get shut out again. I basically did everything short of calling in to reserve a bowl. Spicy pandas gotta eat, you know.\n\nKelaguen Mannok is a cold dish with chopped grilled chicken, lemon, grated coconut, peppers, and onions. Some minced Bird's Eye chili also gets added to make it a tad spicier. I honestly don't know what took me so long to order this. OK, so there are 700 food carts in Portland. Can't find this elsewhere (at least to my knowledge).\n\nWith all due respect to the Bird's Eye chili, the lemon really makes this dish pop that much more. The refreshing aspect keeps me coming back for another bite. Slowly but surely, the heat will intensify, but it's not gonna make me race to the nearest water fountain.\n\nHineksa Agaga (red rice) is really white rice with achotte added to give it its color. It's characterized as having a slightly sweet, nutty, and peppery flavor. Achotte is basically used like saffron to flavor and color rice.\n\nMake sure you ask for the Finadene, because that stuff is awesome. Soy sauce, lemon, chili peppers, onions. The heart of Chamorro cuisine. Add it to your rice and Kelaguen Mannok, then thank me after you've recovered from your food coma.\n\nAnother awesome cart with delicious food! I'll be back for sure.","1905":"Delicious and flavorful food. Nearly everything is outstanding. I love the ramen with their own special fresh eggs that they use wow! really, i never knew a regular egg could be so fresh buttery and deep orangey gold color. It tells you something about a restaurant that pays attention to even basic details like  an ordinary egg. What's even better is that the owners remember me and my boyfriend and know and remember exactly what we like outstanding customer service and warm hospitality! They go out of their way to accommodate us on all of our orders. Also their dishes are perfectly sized overflowing with delicious flavors! Go to eat here! You will not be disappointed.","1906":"What we loved about Hopdoddy:\n- Alex, our server. She was extremely attentive and friendly.\n- Atmosphere. It was hip enough for SoCo or any large urban city.\n- Beer Selection. A refined selection of micro brews.\n- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.\n- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.\n- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the \"40 min\" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an \"E\" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.\n\nWe really wanted to like our whole dining experience at Hopdoddy but the burgers unfortunately were dry and the accompanying veggies did not maintain their expected crispness. The queuing concept a la \"Fuddruckers\" could have been more effective if there were more than 2 smiling faces waiting to take your order. When we arrived this past Saturday night, we told the wait just order our food would be 40 mins, we were steps from the front door (.... and I \"know\"..... what was I expecting, it is SATURDAY night  for god's sake). Luckily, the queue flows past the bar where you are able pick up drink while waiting. \nAnd so like any good troopers, we made the best of our experience  focusing on the all of the things we enjoy about our evening - chatting it up with the people in the queue, marveling at the creative way an 8 top table could be transformed to accommodate a combination of various sized dining parties by merely moving a panel that resembled a large chalk board establishing a new line of demarcation, the amazing Chile Cheese sauce, and the fact we did try someplace new for dinner.","1907":"We had a great time here. $10 gets you a nice tasting glass and 5 tastes. We all liked the beers, and they gave us lots to talk about and compare. Staff was friendly, enthusiastic, and knew their brews ! \n\nI'm not sure the space was heated. It was quite chilly. So if you're going in the colder months, bundle up! \n\nGood place to go before heading over to Decatur proper for dinner.","1908":"I came here on a mission for one thing and one thing only, the beignet sundae.  For those who don't the beignet is New Orleans version of the doughnut.  In my opinion the beignet is one of the best Disney desserts you can get.\n\nMy trusted guide Disney Food Blog recommended getting cappuccino ice cream so I got that along with the Nutella ice cream.  I would just pick one flavor next time, but it was still good.  Now how good is it in my opinion, real good but not amazing.   This is definitely worth a try.","1909":"As a farewell lunch (aka celebration) of one of my coworkers last days, we ventured over to Max & Dylans for some delicious middle of the day treats. We started off the meal with their philly cheese steak spring rolls. (I did not make that up.) The concept sounded ridiculous- but I have NEVER enjoyed a philly cheese steak more (and I'm from PA). Wanting a lighter lunch, I ordered their French Onion soup which was fantastic- perfect portion to fill me up and still make me feel light enough to finish the day. Luckily, my coworkers ordered their infamous mac & cheese so I could steal a few bites. It was refreshingly light, yet flavorful- cooked to mac & cheese perfection. I loved the atmosphere- with a loft-style layout, nice Euro-feeling bar when you walk in and unique artwork that makes you keep the kids at home. I will definitely return here for lunch (or dare I say dinner), and call it another success of Downtown Crossing!\n\nP.S. After being inside all morning and wanting a little Vitamin D- I was irrevocably happy to find my myself sitting underneath a ceiling of windows beaming sunlight on me as if I had opted out of going to work and instead laid by the Charles and relaxed. (That only lasted about 5 seconds, when I found myself glancing at my watch wondering if we'll make it back to work in time.) Max & Dylans got me through work on Friday!!","1910":"Took forever to get our bubble tea made and then it was meh at best.  I'm going to guess the froyo experience is better as we were the only ones there getting the bubble tea.","1911":"Christine's is a homey restaurant with attentive service, but mediocre food. I came for breakfast and was immediately seated and greeted by our server, who was knowledgable of the menu. The offerings are pretty basic (breakfast combos, omelettes, etc.), but do the job, and coffee refills were constant.","1912":"Had brunch here for the first time on a Sunday and the wait time was not bad at all. This place is pretty average. Their brunch menu is really small and their food is on really small plates, too. It's a little odd because I felt like I had to eat cautiously so as to not drop food. The food was good, but again, it's just average.","1913":"Damn, I dont know what happened here but the waffle style has totally changed. I walked over to Saus from my work in the financial district Saturday night, I had my heart set on the waffle and they have the best sauces. However, what I got wasn't the liege waffle with the crunchy pearl sugar that I'm used to getting but ratjher a thicker smaller version of just a regular waffle. What happened, was it just an off night that one of the workers just threw together a regular waffle or has the style of the waffle totally changed? The sauces were still very good. \n\nHopefull its just an off night and I can go back and update my review.","1914":"Jerk in the grey ponytail tried to tell me I had to accept his offer for all items I wanted to sell as a lump, and he would not give me a separate price for each. So what if I brought in each piece separately ... I couldn't be bothered to argue with the idiot, so he got to see my back...leaving the store with their lost business. I'm giving the books and records away for free to the thrift stores, rather than deal with those jerks.","1915":"Marutama specializes in chicken broth ramen and they do it excellently well, out of the dozens of ramen places on robson street this is the place to go for chicken broth; the broth here is so rich and stands out a lot more compared to other places\n\nThe noodles here are freshly made and has a superb texture, noodle refills here are also very quick which is great\n\nPros:\n+ Chicken broth\n+ Noodles\n+ Simple menu\n+ Style\/atmosphere of restaurant \n\nCons:\n- Not much variety for sides\/drinks\n- Location isn't very noticeable from robson st","1916":"I had a horrible experience staying at a doubletree several months ago and was given a certificate for one night to give them another try. My experience was worse than the last time! Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill...I will never stay at another Doubletree again. \nThis particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors. I could live with that ..the issue was the cleanliness and the service. \nThe king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean. Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! \nThe bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM . We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing, etc. about 3 AM. We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it. These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us! Sorry, will not be staying here again. I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one!","1917":"Service was terrible and the kitchen \"forgot\" my order, everybody from my table Finnish all the food but my food doesn't come . We won't be back.","1918":"A few years ago I ordered from Thaitation based on the yelp reviews. I'm so glad I did!! There is only one other Thai place in Boston that rivals Thaitation and that's Brown Sugar....and apparently the chef at Thaitation was the chef at Brown Sugar for 13 years, so that explains that. \n\nI've eaten in once but order delivery regularly. Delivery is always on time or within reason, which I appreciate. \n\nThe Old Lady Spicy with shrimp (my #1) Pineapple Cashew Shrimp, Fishermans's Madness, Drunken Noodle and Mango Fried Rice are among my favorites. Their soups, specifically the wonton are always a pleasant addition to my order and the honey glazed spareribs are delish. \n\nMy only complaint is that I like really spicy food and most of the time it's not as spicy as I like it. I ask for it to be really, really, really spicy and sometimes it is but most times it's not. Maybe my tongue is dead from all the spice. \n\nI won't eat Thai elsewhere (unless it's Brown Sugar) because inevitably I will be disappointed.","1919":"Went on Sunday night, staff was nice.  food was good, price \"is what it is\", but I just miss the days of Red Lobster being a dimly lit with nice music softly playing in background fancy restaurant.  now its loud rock music and babies crying near so it's like for these prices I can go to Park Ave.","1920":"This is a well-spent hour and $10. Our tour leader Renzo, a freshman, was engaging, funny, full of interesting facts.","1921":"We were supposed to have reservations for 4 tonight, having made the reservations days ago.  We received a message this afternoon that there was a problem with their reservations and we no longer had one.  No apology, no accomodation for what plans we had made days ago because something messed up in house.  This is on top of having my brother's birthday there a couple months ago, which my sister-in-law planned with a lot of effort and they screwed up those reservations as well making everyone wait two hours and comping 3 appetizers for the inconvenience.  I had been there when it was Tavern on the Water and clearly the new management is running around with its head cut off not knowing which way is up.  Although a great location, I cannot anticipate trying to go back to this place again.","1922":"I love Dutch bro, the only thing I find strange is the turn over rate at this location they just come in go. There only a few staff members  that seem to been there for long time. I rather see faces that I recognize then new faces every day.","1923":"Not what we were expecting.  The self serve coffee was amazing.  And the food was exactly what we were looking for.  I wanted something that wouldn't put me down for a nap.  Ordered their poached eggs with avocado and grilled tomatoes on toast (English muffin) with a fresh side salad.  Meal was done perfectly, very tasty and filling.  Menu is pretty extensive including some generously portioned dishes with sausage, chorizo and crispy fried tomatoes.  Small, single room cafe feel with friendly wait staff.  We would go back for the food.   Hit the spot!","1924":"Picked up a to go order. Literally the worst food we have had in a long time. My pasta was not cooked, they forgot my husbands beans. Just a joke. I called and the manager did refund our money but was so cold on the phone like I was inconveniencing her. We will not be going back to this location ever again.","1925":"What a great place to dine with friends.  This restaurant, in the Rosen Shingle Resort, is among the best in the area, which is why, we could not believe how empty it was on a Friday evening.  It certainly wasn't because of the food or service which were superb!  All our entrees (pan seared scallops, grouper, seabass and braised short ribs) were a good size and scrumptious.  JJ, our server, was both very personable and helpful.  For the amazing quality of the food, this definitely is a great place to dine.","1926":"Tasty reasonably priced sushi. Good sized portions.  Service is a bit hit and miss (wait times can be long), but the staff is generally friendly.  Nothing that will make you think you're in Japan, but better than anything else I've found south of the city.  No kids menu, if that sort of thing matters to you (it does to me), though we ordered the fish and chips for our 4 year old, and they were out of this world.","1927":"My wife and I went on a Sunday late afternoon - the place was pretty dead, so that might have made the ambiance seemed more sparse than it actually was - still, the place looks kind of \"cold\". \n\nMy wife had a Chicago-style hot dog, I had the classic gyro, and we both had fries and falafel. The hot dog was fine for what it was, the gyro was good but not memorable, and the falafel was a bit dry and bland.\n\nOther reviews mentioned the fries - they're definitely good, somewhere between shoestring and steak fries, and seasoned well. However, they're not so amazing that I'd feel compelled to come back just for them. \n\nOverall - perfectly serviceable but nothing more.","1928":"Expatriate Games\n\nAfter going to Beast a couple of years ago and falling madly in food love, I knew I'd give Expatriate a shot. \n\nFirst things first, the website is a real turnoff to me. It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.\n\nMoving along.\n\nCrab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.\n\nChinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.\n\nOnion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. \n\nBrussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. \n\nKorean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.\n\nThe space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. \n\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it. \n\nOne of the best meals around. I'll be back again and again. Truly special in a town where the bar is set pretty high.","1929":"Curra's is a gem in the the waste land of Tex-Mex. This Oaxacan style bar\/grill is by far my favorite Mexican food in the city. I love it. \nThis place is rightly neon, filled with cheap beer and not too pretty. But the spices are rich, the plates are satisfying, and I can think of nothing better than eating here after a long day hiking or kayaking. \nAll the sauces are exceptional!\nWhile the meat was not the shmanciest thing in the world, it's dressed up with an expert hand and I could expect nothing better for the price. The seafood is definitely the smartest choice, and the shrimp I had were great. \nI'd also recommend the mole enchiladas, which were fantastic! The mole is rich, dark and perfectly spiced. \nAlso, the coffee! With my addiction, it should be no surprise that I tried it, but I was completely surprised by how wonderful it was. Deep vanilla dark roast is a definite plus for me. \n\nThis place is what Austin should be: fun, reasonably priced, casual, and plain good. Grab a few beers and don't worry how you look, you're in Austin, not SoCo realty magazine.","1930":"Not only did we get in with a minimal wait (ten minutes for four people on a Friday) but the waiter was extremely accommodating! When asked a question (whether it had to do with food or the area; we are not from here) he would find out the answer by looking it up. Our table was clean and our glasses were never empty. We had good food and wonderful service, definitely worth the trip!!!","1931":"I go nearly everyday as it is across from where I live. The gates are always left open by non- dog owner visitors and there is always trash everywhere. I'm constantly prying discarded human food (lots of chicken bones) from my pups mouth. It's also very muddy. Please clean this park up and limit the non- dog owner visitors....","1932":"I think the amount of fun you will have here depends on who you go with and what you want to do. I went with my son today (2\/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. \n\nFamilies with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)\n\nFamilies with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! \n\nFamilies that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. \n\nHowever if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.\n\nOn 2\/23 the one \"roller coaster\", Atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. \n\nHe also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  \n\nThe food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. \n\nThe cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. \n\nSo, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.","1933":"Banzai was the first place I ever had sushi in Austin, and it's truly a-okay. Let me say, though, that when I come here now, I don't come here for the sushi. I'll say right off that bat- don't have the rolls. Even for the price, they are not worth it. They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small. Overall the place is decent. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you know to avoid the rolls you won't leave unhappy.","1934":"Fun izakaya atmosphere, good selection, but sort of feels like a Japanese food theme park\n\nThe menu is extensive and features many of my favorite Japanese dishes.  Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  \n\nPart of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.\n\nThey have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).\n\nThe yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.\n\nIt has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.\n\nEarly and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)\n\nService is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.  Waits for a table can be very long.","1935":"Randomly found myself here on my walk home- didn't know it had reopened! \n\nThe pizza is great, and came out fast. The staff was super friendly, and even offered me a free latte after I ordered a water and then decided I wanted a latte as well (once I layed my eyes on their espresso machine).\n\nSuper impressed- and so happy to have a good pizza spot in my neighborhood!","1936":"So the wife needed to eat so we come in, place is done up nice. This is probably the best looking qdoba I have been to. The staff was real friendly manager was really nice. Of course the food was delicious.","1937":"Ok, I like this place. But since it's in the Good Food Here pod, that's pretty much a given.\n\nI've tried 3 of the dishes, though I don't remember all of the specifics. One of them had sweet glazed pork, which I had never had before... but will definitely have again. Yum! For some of the dishes, the items are separated out on the plate, allowing you to add as much jalepeno or specific veggies as you want. \n\nFor the meat dishes, I think the price is a bit steep  - $7.50 for a decent sized plate of food (the other northern Thai carts have bigger portions for this price). But the vegetarian dishes (or at least the pad dish that I had last time) are a dollar cheaper while still being just as tasty and filling. So as far as economical eating goes, the veg dishes are your best bet, but the other dishes are still really, really yummy - don't cross them off your list completely.","1938":"This restaurant and lounge is a nice addition to Ponce. The interior is contemporary with lounge seating and swings as seating at the bar. Their drinks are excellent and the food is really good. There's not a drink menu yet but there is a beer and wine menu. Although this place just opened, the staff seems to be very knowledgeable and extremely attentive.\n\nI highly recomemd the chicken and waffle sliders, the boogalou wings, and the crab cakes. They also have happy hour specials.  \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that there is valet parking which is typically free for women and $5 for men.","1939":"The ice cream was amazing! I had the chocolate as $@*% and it was very rich and creamy. I would definitely come back based on the quality of ice cream, however the organization and service was terrible!! First off there are no prices listed anywhere that I could see. The menu board only displays the names of the flavors but no descriptions. They also apparently have coffee drinks but there was no menu or prices for this. The shop also has a very poor layout so the line takes way longer than a similar line at salt & straw would take. While the ice cream was delicious, I probably will not be coming back due to the environment of the shop.","1940":"I used this company in Sept 2016 and again in January 2017.  Both moves were extremely smooth, nice, friendly crew, showed up on time, worked hard and did a great job.  I would highly recommend them.","1941":"The Storm Crow is a gem. It has come a long way since it first opened its doors, particularly the food. The menu has a good hearty selection at decent prices. The original $5 menu was enticing but a little off the mark with the quantity and quality. However, that being said the revamped menu has a wider array of delicious options. For example the Elvish Veggie Burger, Chickpea Fries, and Nachos Supreme. I am a vegetarian, and the veggie burger was so good. Also, the chickpea fries were so awesome, definitely recommend them.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite spots to game, that is board game! The array of games is quite the feat. My favourite is Apples 2 Apple and Cards Against Humanity , but I am expanding my horizons. I am pretty sure they have most games your looking for!\n\nLast but not least, the ambience of this place is probably what it is best known for. A fantastical homage to everything fantasy. Overall, if you're looking for a fun, laid-back atmosphere to play board games, drink beer, and revel in your favourite fantasy movie\/book\/or game this is the spot!","1942":"I've now been thrice, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience every time. That being said, I have only limited experience with Dim Sum. I mostly appreciate that they have many vegetarian options, and all are clearly labeled as such. Additionally, I really enjoy the ability to order a variety of many different menu items, and still pay less than $20 for two people. \nOverall, though, I was originally inspired to write a review based on the multiple negative service reviews. Each time I've visited, I was immediately greeted with a smile and verbal hello. They always seem in such high spirits, maybe like they're even having fun! At work! Most recently, we unknowingly walked in 5 minutes before close (which is 9pm, FYI), and still received the same friendly greeting. We offered to leave, but they insisted we stay and even fired up a few things so we could get everything we ordered. They were patient, personable, and showed no sign of frustration or disappointment. As far as I could tell, they really were happy we were there, and were glad to service us, even as they lingered past close while we finished our food.\nThe place is very clean and orderly to boot. I'll definitely visit again! And you should (get sum) too!","1943":"My experience at Eclipse di Luna has always been excellent,  but my last visit was beyond expectation.  Our server Julian was absolutely fabulous and we really enjoyed his service.  His menu suggestions were fabulous. We love every item on the menu and when we had an issue with one dish, he took care of it without hesitation.  We will be heading back again very soon and of course will request Julian as our server!","1944":"Not the best breakfast taco I've ever had in my life but it definitely did the job. We had a big order and they got everything just right which was good! The prices are also very reasonable and there was plenty of parking!","1945":"This cafe is in a dept store in the park royale. Food is pre-made and heated up. The ambiance is nothing special. They were out of half the menu items listed, and offered no compensation for the fact that we had to order the most expensive thing on the menu because they were out of everything else.","1946":"fantastic italian cuisine.  note: by \"italian\" i don't mean just various pastas and your typical chicken saute' dishes--this is a pretty eclectic mix of FANTASTIC seafood, steaks, chops, and pastas.  wine selection is substantial but the mark-up isn't.  the mussels appetizer is an absolute MUST.  can get noisy and crowded at times, but to me this has always been the sign of a great restaurant.  in terms of legitimacy, let me put it this way:  my italian professor (who is an italian immigrant) says Tuccis is her favorite italian place in columbus.  they have a happy hour special at their bar for half price appetizer too, i believe.","1947":"I have never written a review before. But this  place was so horrible that I had to warn others.  We went with a party of 15 people. We had made a reservation. We  got to the restaurant at 6:20. No one came to offer us even menus or water  until  we Had been sitting  for about 35 min.  They had a large party on the other side of the restaurant. They were only paying attention to that side.  There were only two tables with patrons on this side of the restaurant.   There were people \/ staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything.  The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come. Most of us developed headaches .We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out. Close to the end we could not wait anymore. The kids were asleep on the bed\/seating area. We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived.  The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside.  And that the food should be ready soon.  it was 28\u0412\u00b0 and raining, by the way.  Was she out of her mind!  1\/2 of us left while the others waited for the food to come still... \n\nMy husband  stated that this is the most horrible dining experience has ever had","1948":"If you are looking for some tofu chigae. COME HERE! Hands down the best place to go if you are craving hot Korean tofu soup. It is always packed but the wait is worth it. I come here often and it has never failed to be delicious. I have tried the surrounding Korean spots but Kaju will always be #1. My regular order is the mild Kimchi Pork Tofu Chigae.","1949":"We enjoyed our coffee here. Good muffins. Pie is a bit overhyped. I had a slice of chocolate cream pie where my slice had way more cream than filling. Also I wasn't crazy about the piecrust, as it was a bit tough to cut with a fork. Atmosphere is cozy but the place could probably use some better ventilation. When we arrived it was too stuffy, luckily the air came on a little later. But then we ended up leaving early because our eyes started burning (I think they started cooking something up at the time)","1950":"I purchased 2 hrs of moving services from Move Drs on Jan. 24.  I called Move Drs on March 26 or 27 to schedule my move date of April 6, which was ultimately scheduled for 10:00 am. Move Drs called at 10:20 on April 6 to cancel. Their reason was that they had a fire in their office and when I asked, they reported that they did, in fact, have mover crews and trucks available, but the manager decided to bring the crews in to clean up the office instead of taking care of the appointments that they had already committed to. I certainly hope there were other extenuating circumstances.  It seems like a better choice would have been to hire a cleaning crew and kept the moving crews and trucks working to take care of the customers. \n    Move Drs also told me twice they would find another company to move me later that same day but I never received either a call from a new mover, nor a follow-up call from Move Drs. All of this was last minute and ended up costing me substantially more in surcharges since I did not have a prior scheduled appointment. . To me, Move Drs views their business as a one-time customer exposure with little attention to any repeat business and cares nothing about service","1951":"Shari's hands down has the best pies around.  Took our granddaughters there after seeing the lights on Peacock Lane and throughout Portland and before driving through the Winter Wonderland at the Portland International Raceway.  Started an annual family event with the help if Shari's.","1952":"I wasn't expecting the food to be so delicious! I absolutely loved my Paesano - get it hot! The pictures don't even do it justice, my meal was just so good and I definitely got my money's worth. You can get beer cheese for $1.50 to dip your chips in, which I did not do this time but I wish I had! The chips weren't bad on their own but I can only imagine how delicious they would be with the cheese.","1953":"It was a very light ambience with a variety of beers and cocktails. Typically known for eating outside during the summer, it was a  warm winter escape that allowed for catching up with old friends. \n\nWe only got drinks but the food looked wonderful, I wish we could've stayed another day to eat there. The drink menu was exceptional, comprised of great mixed drinks and draft beers. \n\nWould definitely recommend to a friend visiting from out-of-town or for drinks after work.","1954":"I really was excited about Banboo's new place opening up on Alberta. My dining partner and I arrived at 5pm on a Friday and by 6pm it was packed. We ordered the eggplant, skirt steak, pork potato cakes, and asparagus along with two different saki slights.  It was all good, but I was not raving about how wonderful it was. The eggplant was slightly overcharred and the frothy hollandaise on the asparagus left it a little bland. The skirt steak and black bean sauce was very yummy though!  Next time, I'll try more of the meats.  The service was cheery and very enthusiastically described the menu items. Overall, a great addition to Alberta St.","1955":"Ooooh, I really really really loved this place. I was looking for something for a Sunday brunch and found this spot. I had smoked salmon egg Benedict and it was fantastic. Home fries were also sweet. I also tried their French toast for which I had no room left in my stomach but I'm sure it was good. Will go back sometimes very soon and definitely try their French toast as I promised myself","1956":"I've been coming here for about a year now and I love this salon. They're always busy but get you seated pretty quick. Manis, pedis, waxing- Ive always had generally great work and I'm pretty picky! They play cool movies if you watch and you can get wine or a cool drink too. :)","1957":"Microblading- Catherine did an amazing job Microblading my eyebrows. She was able to make them full and even. It was quite a job because I had very little natural brow to work with and they were extremely uneven. Catherine took the time to make sure that I was comfortable and numb (she uses an amazing numbing cream and I didn't feel any pain).  She is definitely a perfectionist and made sure that I was 100 % satisfied with her work. They look absolutely amazing and I am ecstatic that I no longer have to spend 15-20 min every morning putting makeup on my brows! Catherine has a very cute, clean and relaxing studio that is easy to get to. She is professional, timely and talks you through the process which made me feel very confident in her abilities. I could not be happier with my results! Thank you so much, Catherine! You're a miracle worker!","1958":"Great little hole in the wall place for Ramen. Simple menu with few options which is a huge plus in the add on craziness that seems prevalent these days. HOT broth, great taste. Will be back again!","1959":"This is the closest bar to my house and I've been coming here since it was Agenda (thank goodness it's not Assets anymore.)\n\nThe bartender is awesome!  The beer selection is great!  I love a good hefeweizen and this place always has a couple good ones to choose from.  I'm not a huge IPA guy but I also really enjoy the Stein Haus IPA.\n\nThe food is unique and the few items I've had have been very tasty if not slightly overpriced in my opinion.\n\nTwo pinball machines (I wish you guys would rotate them though) and free corn hole outside near the large, nice, covered patio.\n\nThis is a great place to come share a beer with a friend or two.\n\nOne of the things I really appreciate about this establishment is I get the impression that the staff really cares about making this a great place to hangout.  From the way they treat the guests to the decor that I've seen the bartender work on they really put themselves into this place.  Good job, keep it up!","1960":"pretty great, quick, easy, cheap lunch. went with a coworker for the first time, and i've been a little underwhelmed by most of the lunch places. had a great tofu bun- they cook the tofu really nicely.  i like tofu with flavor that i can afford--and this has been the best I've had so far..  busy with a long line at lunch, but goes fast and is a really more-than-enough-delicious-food stop.","1961":"Very trendy and hip in a good way although the service was slammed and the spicy food left us craving cold beers which were tough to get.  We tried the papaya salad - good not great; curry chicken things - good not great; and the beef which was fabulous.\n\nThey did a nice job of accomodating our kids.","1962":"Loved it! Beautiful!  Great customer service, clean rooms, nice pools! Added bonus was the kids activities.  Every day they have a schedule of activities to keep the kiddos busy. \n\nWe had a 1 bedroom king suite with full kitchen. It was plenty of room for our family and very peaceful.  It was like a home away from home.\n\nWe will definitely stay again.","1963":"Always a line and now I know why! Visiting from Hawaii we don't get this type of food at all.  Everything was savory and tasty. Honestly this place made the most impact on my taste buds during my vacation.  As they say, eat where the locals eat!","1964":"Downgrade. The coffee is still great, if you can get there when the place is open. I understand that struggling to make a buck at a coffee shop can make you cut corners but closing so early really turns away business. And as a personal note, I hate the alt christian rock that creeps into the music sometimes. \n\nThe atmosphere is great if you need a quite place to work.","1965":"Lady was polite when I walked in but the shop is really small and not much selection. The flowers that were there looked old.  They don't have anything there where you could make an order for the same day. Never had a delivery from them but I've heard bad stories from my neighbors","1966":"The food is very heavy and I would never recommend coming here for ANYTHING light. My friends and I frequent it more as a sports bar. Lots of TV and great for watching basketball or football. There's even a nice little garden area with a ping pong table for a friendly match. \n\nIf you're coming for brunch, I recommend their take on the chicken and waffle. I'm not a fan of syrup so I subbed gravy and wasn't disappointed. The donut thing is overrated. Reminded me more of boiled bagels.","1967":"I checked out Mike's Comics it was definitely a good recommendation by one of my other collector friends their prices are pretty fair and they have a large inventory of stuff I definitely rate it in my top 3 of local comic\/toy places","1968":"I am Canadian so I know my donuts, I grew up on Tim Horton's but these are a different breed. My boyfriend and I sent to Portland last summer and our Airbnb host recommended blue star vs. Voodoo and I've had to go back every time. \n\nThe donuts are tasty, sweet but sophisticated. Hard to say which flavor is my favorite but try them all, you really can't go wrong. \n\nThere are a few locations so I have never had to line up around the block for a donut and they serve stumpton coffee at most places!","1969":"I had l\u0413\u00a9 cheeseburger, pink, naked fries which were delicious, clean oil. Bun toasted and buttery. The sauce for the burger, light but flavory. Cheese's texture and light flavor, heated just right releasing the subtle oils from the formagio! Ask for the house made bar-b-que sauce on the side--dipping yummy . Sarah  the bar-maid is lovely, attentive! Great Xperience!","1970":"Wonderful coffee house with friendly staff, healthy food, and free wi-fi!! The space is nicely decorated: bright, bold colors, & inviting on the first floor and dark & cozy in the downstairs area. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. The cappuccinos (read: European style) and croissants were lovely. The Combo Plate with tabouli, salad, and hummus was fresh, filling, delicious, and reasonably priced! The ample seating, inviting ambiance, and good food makes this place a great addition to my coffee shop rotation.","1971":"This was one of the few restaurants in Walt Disney World that my husband and I had yet to try so we went in with a completely open mind.  It was ok.  The food was fine.  I had the gnocchi and he had the pork tenderloin.  Both were very good, and he even said his was excellent. I had 3 main issues: one, they made us wait past our reservation time and when we were seated there were many open tables in the dining room.  Two, the dining room was very large and quite noisy, even at 8:00 at night.  Still not a deal breaker. My main issue was with the ambiance.  With a restaurant called The Wave, with a waiting area that is all lit up in ocean blue, it was very confusing to have an orange and gold, retro vibe throughout.  Kind of confusing.  I know it's called \"The Wave of American Flavors\", but still, it tries to identify as also being ocean related.  All in all, you will have a good meal.","1972":"The same reaction after my third visit: small portion, overpriced, and most significantly, a meh experience.  Today it was the Hash: ground uninspired pork, a few potato cubes, some creme fresh type concoction topped with a fried egg.  It was good, but I expected so much more from such a renowned venue.\n\nMy server was very friendly and gave a generous sample of a so-so soup.\n\n...six spots in a very difficult area for parking.  No more.","1973":"I have been going for years the people here are always kind and nice but today there was a colored lady and man behind the counter who were extremely rude and got the order wrong! Further as I walked to get straws leaving my card at the counter the man accused me on not paying before I left ! DD needs to hire better staff or I am never going there again","1974":"I would not recommend this place if you are looking for delicious lobster.  The lobsters were chewy like eating rubber.  Over cooked. I spoke with the manager and he was very cordial to me. I asked about how long they were cooking the lobsters.  He advised they were pre cooked.  Then later reheated.  My whole family was disappointed \nThe manager offered to bring us fresher lobsters but it was all the same.  Very disappointing.  I paid the hefty bill and didn't complain. Our server was very nice and attentive and I tipped her very well.  It's not her fault lobsters are cooked twice!  The rest of the food on the buffet was just ok.   Never again.  Red lobster was fantastic the next night tho!","1975":"Holly cow, amazing! Ordered a boba milk tea which is always my go too anywhere. It was fresh and yummy. Bragging right to the mojo crepe ..Mind blowing good. Frequent flyer miles here I come","1976":"Yelp.  Worth gold!\n\nMy daughter is a student and has had some car trouble.  I won't mention the other garage in this review, but the difference between them and Kiser is more than night and day.  Because of the horrible experience at the other garage, and the fact that I'm 800 miles away, I turned to Yelp to find some recommendations.  I'm so glad I did.\n\nThe battery in her car died.  This is not the first time, so I really wanted an overall check out of the electrical system to try to find out what was causing the problem.  Talk about leaving yourself totally exposed to a bank account drain!!!  But I have faith, and the other reviews tell it true.  These guys are honest and trustworthy, and really made me (and my daughter) feel like they cared about our situation.  What a surprise to find out it was only like $100 for all their work.  I'm already talking to Steve about my next repairs.\n\nHighly recommended!","1977":"There is definitely a wow factor when you enter the restaurant from the hotel.  The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a \"different\" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future, I'd like to eat outside as the seating is on the water.","1978":"This is nothing but the real ting without frills and full of fantastic flavor for days! Not far from the Hartsfield airport, this meal is worth the flight here ! It's portions are generous and for less than $15, you can have a gourmet meal with a drink ( try Ting, the national soft drink of Jamaica) . Please know that my Caribbean queen mother will kill me if I give full marks to any  restaurant serving Jamaican food beyond her own kitchen.  So with that in mind, please make a trip to find a rating on your own.  They have the usual suspects... Goat, curried chicken , ox tail stew, rice and peas, stewed chicken, and escovitch fish.  You really cannot go wrong here. This place uses the right amount of spice without compromising authenticity to ginger the American pallet.","1979":"We dined here before a Fox Theater event.  The interior was very upscale and modern- I really liked it.  For food, I had the vegetable tempura, which was nice because it had a lot of different vegetables.  For dinner, I had the Sea Salt Chicken with three types of chilis, garlic, and salt.  It came with a sweet sauce and a spicy sauce, both of which were tasty.  The portion was not that big, but it's not like we were going to take leftovers to the Fox with us.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the chocolate volcano cake and the banana tempura.  The Volcano cake was wonderfully decadent but we didn't care too much for the banana dessert.  Unfortunately, prices were pretty high for the quantity you get.  I wouldn't make this a regular stop for me, but it's a nice place to go before a show or for a date.  Plus parking is free.","1980":"We had Chinese brunch and it was awesome~!  Yum Yum.  \nPrice was definitely cheap cheap.  It's a small place, and it as packed!  We got there around 1:30 so we didn't have to wait long for lunch to be served.  \n\nBut I would go back for food.","1981":"NEVER AGAIN.  I have lived in Newton for 25 years and every five years or so I get soft and give this place another try.  This will be the last time unless my family decides to hold my wake there as some cruel joke.  They treat the chips and salsa like they are caviar and their customers like they are a worthless commodity.  A friendly waitress could have provided some solace, but alas, we were sorely disappointed there too; can you say \"attitude on steroids\"?.  The last thing Newton Centre needs is another coffee shop or bank, but someone needs to pave this place over and put the rest of us out of our misery...","1982":"The best pasta in Vancouver, bar none.  Consistently and exceptional good, the pasta here is made fresh in house daily.  The traditional roman pastas are really the highlight, from the cacio & pepe to the various iterations of guanciale.\n\nWe dine here regularly, and it never disappoints.","1983":"Chocolate. Nuff said. But since that's not enough words for a review. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Vanilla, chocolate, chocolate, strawberry, chocolate, chocolate, and other flavors associated with chocolates.","1984":"Went here last year for a candlelight dinner with the GF. This place is amazing. food was delicious and the atmosphere was super romantic. live piano player to set the mood right. will definitely be returning here again some day. Love it.","1985":"One of the few large non-Asian pubs\/bars in Richmond, this place stands out amongst the closed businesses at night.\n\nIt is always bustling and is a great place to go grab a brew and relax and hang out with friends.\n\nHanging with old friends as well as meeting new people is equally easy here.","1986":"I've been here about 5 times and loved it each time. If you are looking for the best Ethiopian food in the ATL, look no further then Desta. \n\nYou can't go wrong with this restaurant; food is delicious, and staff are very friendly and accommodating. \n\nI like coming here with a group and ordering all the different meats and vegetables to go along with the injera. The lamb and fillet mignon are especially tasty. Also, very good Ethiopian coffee.","1987":"Classic local diner kinda place. Coffee ain't Peet's but above average trick stop blend. \nThe pancakes rock. The huevos is my favorite. The breakfast burrito is above average and large. \nMain thing here is the service. Fast. Pleasant. Love it. \nOh, and it's a clean joint too.","1988":"Just ordered through UberEATS tonight. Food was probably a 4, however we were missing one side and the turkey avocado sandwich had no avocado.","1989":"We dined at Chinatown this past weekend for the first time in years, but this the first visit upstairs. After reading other reviews we were a little skeptical but we figured we'd give it a go anyway.\n\nPros: Entree were delicious, we seasoned and served hot and quickly. Beer was cold and served with a cold glass. Service was prompt and server was polite and fun. Prices were reasonable for the quality of entrees.\n\nCons: Decor is tired and furniture and carpet is in dire need of being cleaned or replaced. The menus were sticky (plastic covered pages). The place just felt dirty which made the experience uncomfortable. Steamed pot stickers were chewy and tasted like they had been sitting a while. Prices were high based on the general feel and the lackluster pot stickers.\n\nI am really on the fence giving Chinatown 3 stars. I think this place could warrant 4 stars with some cleaning and an overall re-upholstering. On the other hand this could easily fall to a 2 star restaurant if something doesn't change soon.","1990":"Tavern in the Square is the kind of place I would come back to for simple appetizers to get some food in my belly when I haven't had a chance to have dinner before having drinks. I ordered the electric lemonade it was delicious and kind of strong despite all the ice. I am glad I split the big dig fries with someone as it was huge portion, and really good. Although waffle fries smothered in cheese and sour cream,  you have to be  a real moron to mess that up.\n\nWhen I first arrived and was waiting for others to joined me, I sat at the bar next to some guy, who got meatloaf that didn't seem all that great, I caught some of his conversation with the bartender and he was asking her what kind of meat was in there, and said it was dry and tasteless and didn't taste like beef. She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner. This seems more like the kind of place to grab a few simple dishes. The bar was a nice size but pretty crowded by eight, but it was Friday. \n\nOne last note the waitresses and some of the bartenders seem to be lacking in customer service skills. When I first arrived I saw them clustered at the end of the bar, I looked their way for a while, and eventually had to wave my hand.  There was a blonde facing me she looked over blankly several times and didn't tell the bartender who was in charge of my side that I need service so I ended up waiting a while before she came over. After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude. The red headed waitress who ended up serving me was great, although I  felt bad because I ordered from her then tipped at the table so I owe her one next time I go there.","1991":"Both egg sandwiches and latte were great! I highly recommend rosemary frittata with spinach. A nice place to begin your day!","1992":"A nice bar restaurant on an Orlando Ave corner, Winter Park.\nI tried their Square 1 Red beer -- great flavor for my taste! - it was only a bit fruity but subtle, so I loved it.\nToga Party burger with feta cheese and other good stuff, and side of beans were delish. I've come here before and knew I'd return. Servers are super nice - and super friendly if you're a repeat customer. We sat in a round, corner booth - the cowhide upholstery adds to the nice modern western decor.","1993":"There's some good curry here.  Just remember to order extra meat because they're extra chintzy when it comes to that.","1994":"Their mixed grill is really good. And so it the eskandar. But they are a bit pricey. Would go back every once in a while. Oh the lavash is just excellent.","1995":"Pretty good value for the price paid but nothing to write home about. If you need a quick carb load with tasty cheap bevy this will hit the spot. You do to get to build your own dish and have gobs of ingredients to chose from which is a nice touch.","1996":"Put A Bird On It!\nWell, IN it. They have finches in a cage...looks like an interesting merchandising fixture in this quaint boutique.\nI loved the feeling that I was finding one-of-a-kind trinkets.  They have a little of everything from clothing to jewelry to books to decor to perfume to toys.\nYou can spend quite a lot of time rummaging through this cluttered, yet organized, store.","1997":"This is one of the best basic hotel experiences I've had. Our room was very clean and well appointed. The front desk staff was attentive and friendly. Breakfast was diverse and tasting and there was a ton of seating. The pool water was comfortably warm. I took my daughter for their American Girl package and it was so special. Really great accommodations.","1998":"I have been put Back together by Doctor Brian Baisinger and Doctor Greg Lekas over and over for many years. I have referred well over a hundred injured police officers, athletes and friends to the Clearwater Clinic. So far I have never had a single person I refereed come back to me with anything less than a enthusiastic and positive review of their experience. \n\nThe thing I appreciate the most is the fact everyone at Clearwater is interested and expert at getting me fixed up and back in the game. I've never felt like my treatment is being extended unnecessarily. The treatment is effective and designed to get me back to 100 percent as quickly as possible. \n\nIf you want experts to help you heal and get the most out of your physical capabilities Clearwater Clinic is the only choice. Integrity, honesty and expertise are all hallmarks of the doctors and staff.","1999":"Fantastic flavor in their chicken tibs and injera, anticipatory service, and still easy on the budget - they even have Monday specials for their chicken dishes. If I lived in Atlanta, this would be a regular stop.","2000":"Not the cleanest place but they sure have some great dishes. Love their fries, soups (African chicken peanut is the best). Fish & Chips spendy for what you get but good. Salads can be unusual but very tasty.\nDining outside in the summer on the patio\/deck is wonderful although noisy from the street. \nStaff is \"so so\" when it comes to friendly-could work on being a bit more cheerful.","2001":"I ordered delivery from City Thai through GrubHub.  I was given an estimate of 1-2 hours, which was understandable given that the weather was crappy.\n\nAfter 2.5 hours I contacted GrubHub to find out where my food was.  If the restaurant needed to cancel because of weather or some other reason, that is one thing, but I heard nothing from them.  GrubHub reached out to the restaurant who said they were starting my order and promised it would be delivered in 25-30 ADDITIONAL minutes.  The restaurant had confirmed this, and I was told they were offering the delivery service directly.  OK, fine, at least I will get to eat dinner, and at this point it's too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else.\n\nAt 3.5 hours, I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after 9:00, and the restaurant was closed.  I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here, but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai.  It is honestly inexcusable.  It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather, or driver issues, etc, but to provide (sparse) updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un-freaking-believable.  There are plenty of other decent Thai places in Portland, please don't waste your time with this one."},"date":{"0":"2014-10-11 03:34:02","1":"2015-07-03 20:38:25","2":"2013-05-28
