{"essay":"\"I am currently a Special Education Math teacher in a high needs middle school. My students are eager to learn but lack proper classroom resources.

In addition to learning the language, my students come from low income homes. All of the students in my school are eligible for free or reduced lunch due to the household incomes. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are classified as emotionally disturbed, academically delayed or learning disabled. They need all the help they can get to get them to the same level as their middle school peers. Most don't have the supplies due to the financial strain buying school supplies puts on the family. Having a large supply of pens, pencils, glue sticks, stapler, and other classroom basics, would be a blessing each day. Most of these materials are needed for everyday lessons, while others like the glue sticks & the stapler, can assist with hands-on learning and project building. If you assist us in acquiring these materials you would be saving many less fortunate from the humiliation of explaining why they are unprepared. I am also requesting visual aids for our classroom walls so they can reference current and prior math concepts. \r\\n\r\\nIf you think back, one of the best things about the first day of school is having brand new sharpened pencils, new art supplies, and a the desire to learn. With your help, our classroom will be ready to start the new school year off right with these basic, necessary school supplies. \""}

My students look forward to science every day with the anticipation of Christmas, but our school lacks the supplies needed to make it fun.  The science closet is antiquated and full of dusty slides to show during class time.  There are a few microscopes, but most of them are broken.  My students are desperate for materials to learn science like more affluent students. \r\\n\r\\nThe materials that we are requesting will be utilized during our Electricity unit of study.  Students will create series and parallel circuits, design paths for electricity to activate buzzers, and explore how electricity works in our world.  Most of the unit will be taught utilizing groups of students in order to allow for collaboration and cooperation.

{"essay":"\"Language is power.  People are often judged on their ability to clearly articulate their ideas and opinions to others.  Children are not simply born with robust vocabularies.

Children from low income areas and non-English speaking households are not surrounded with people that will enrich their English vocabulary. Their parents are unable to read them books with interesting vocabulary words. I am looking to give my kindergarten students the power of language.  The children in my classroom come from Washington Heights, a predominantly Dominican and Puerto Rican community in New York City.  All of the students are English language learners.  Many of my students enter kindergarten knowing little or no English. I am at an advantage to get them at such an age when learning a second language comes much more easily then for an adult.  In addition to teaching my students how to speak English, I want to provide my students with exposure to rich language they are not exposed to in their homes.  \r\\n\r\\nI have been creating my own vocabulary instruction based on the current research of Dr. Isabel Beck and Dr. Margaret McKeown.

{"essay":"\"My students are in second grade in a low-income school where 95% of the students are English Language Learners. This community is a high-need community with lots of homelessness. The students in our school all qualify for reduced lunch, and face great adversity. \r\\n\r\\nThe children in my classroom come from homes where their parents speak little to no English. Most of the homes have no computer or Internet accessibility so many of the children come to school eager to use the Smartboard in our classroom to play learning games and to access the classroom website which has information on projects which we are doing in class. But since our laptop has broke the children are not able to work with the Smartboard. \r\\n\r\\nIf my students were granted a classroom laptop I could pay the monthly bill to integrate wireless Internet on it. Our school has many problems with wiring and therefore half of the school has no Internet, but we all have Smartboards. I have always paid for the Internet access, but because of many cutbacks to our educational system our laptop will never be replaced and our Smartboard will just collect dust, because I can't afford to purchase a laptop for the class. \r\\n\r\\nWhen the children use the Smartboard they are more anxious to learn because they play learning games which either sharpen their skills, or make them want to master the skills so they can achieve goals. If we receive the laptop the children will be able to create PowerPoint presentations discussing our curriculum themes and they will be able to once again use the Internet to learn more in small groups. We would be forever grateful if our wish for a laptop is granted. Thank you for taking the time \""}

How can my students go beyond what a book tells and into the world of self-thinking and own conclusions?  \r\\n\r\\nMy class is composed of 29 fifth grade students.

Our school is a great environment for them, but because of our rural location we have very limited financial resources.  Teachers in our school have become very creative in order to bring new experiences to our students and to encourage and excite them.   \r\\n\r\\nHaving this type of accessible technology in the classroom that is within my ability to control and adapt to our needs will dramatically affect student learning.

{"essay":"\"Math-phobia is something many of us suffer from. I believe that fear is something that develops from a lack of early skills in math, and grows and grows when that deficit is not addressed. My goal is for all of my little scholars to have a great level of comfort with numbers right from the start. \r\\n\r\\nMy students come from all backgrounds. I have students from many different countries and languages, as well as those from our local area who come from very diverse family backgrounds. Our school serves a large population of students in homeless situations, students with emotional or behavioral disorders, and students on the autism spectrum. This unique mix of students makes our school a wonderful community where all are welcome and all can learn. We have a staff devoted to addressing the needs of each student, not a one-size-fits-all educational approach.\r\\n\r\\nThe students in my room are more than just a diverse group of children. From the first day of kindergarten, they learned that they are \"\"scholars.\"\" They take this very seriously, and each one is trying every day to show that they are devoted to learning. They are kind, responsible, and care about making our classroom and school a better place. I could not be more proud of my little group of scholars! \r\\n\r\\nWe've been using math trays with great success. However, I have very limited supplies and resources in terms of math manipulatives, so in order to keep our math trays engaging and to continue to build math skills as the year goes on, my mathematicians need more math activities and supplies. \r\\n\r\\nThese resources will be used to create math trays: practice activities that students choose themselves and work on independently to build and maintain the \"\"big ideas\"\" of kindergarten level math. \r\\n\r\\nThe supplies this project will buy include basic math manipulatives like counters and pattern blocks, as well as an assortment of math activities and games at a variety of skill levels. These supplies help build on the kindergarten math skills of cardinality and counting, patterns, shapes, and early addition and subtraction skills. The activities this project will provide will help my students get student-directed practice in these skills in an effortless, engaging, and fun way. \r\\n\r\\nDonations to this project will give my scholars a strong, stress-free foundation in math skills that will make a difference in all of their future math learning. It will also give me the opportunity to work with small groups to address specific challenges. \r\\n\r\\nContributing to our math trays will help ensure that these scholars, and my future kindergartners, will have a better chance of avoiding the math-phobia that many of us know so well. \""}
{"essay":"\"Do you remember the last time you took out your photo album? Do you remember how you felt when reminiscing about these unforgettable memories with your friends and families? That's what I want to provide to my students whose parents can't afford a decent camera to save these childhood memories. \r\\n\r\\nMy preschool students are extremely smart and they have an insatiable thirst for learning. These 3 and 4 year olds spend 7 hours a day in my classroom, exploring, investigating and learning. So much of their time is spent here building lasting memories that parents don't get to share with them. How often do you say, \"\"wow, time flies\"\"? Well, it happens even quicker at this age. It is so unfortunate that poverty can prevent parents from buying a camera and capture these valuable and sentimental memories of their child. People would choose to save their pictures over any other documents, because they know memories are irreplaceable and priceless. Hurricane Sandy made ravaging damages here in our town, memories lost due to water and wind. Not only do we need to rebuild, but we need to be able to preserve the memories we experience, so we can remember where we came from and where we are going. It is essential to remember that one snapshot of our lifetime could bring so much happiness. \r\\n\r\\nAs a teacher in a high poverty school district, I witness the essential elements that students and parents need other than my teaching expertise. My students are preschoolers, they can't write nor remember the multiple experiences they have throughout the day. My students need a Sony Camera and Macbook Air to share and remember their childhood experiences. With pictures, students remember what they did and all the feelings they had a any one particular time. They can explain what they did, who they played with, and what they learned.  More importantly, parents can indirectly understand and share their little ones feelings and experiences. I want to capture those moments for my students and their parents, all the while editing their  pictures with the Macbook Air.  I will be able to use the pictures to document students' progress and write more meaningful anecdotal notes with visual representations. They say \"\"A picture is worth a thousand words\"\", and in preschool this phrase is even truer. \r\\n\r\\nThis project will make a direct impact on my work, but more importantly the result of this project will have a lasting impact on the students and the parents for a lifetime. I don't just work for my students, I work for an entire community at large. A community in high poverty, is still a community that deserves to have everything our world has to offer. Pictures do not cost a fortune to many of us, but for a minority group it is not even an option due to their financial condition. \""}

{"essay":"\"\"\"Where words fail, music speaks,\"\" said Hans Christian Andersen. My students learn volumes each year in their core classes, but with no music program k-12 their education is inadequate. They have immense creative passion, but no outlet for it... yet. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are American Indian students living on a reservation in one of the poorest counties in the country, and attend one of the lowest performing schools in the country. Many are two or more years below grade level in their math and reading levels. In the context of frequent frustration and low expectations, the moments of pure learning are exhilarating to them. Even so, the diversity of their learning in school, even on the most successful day, is limited to their core classes - Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts. I have seen their artistic expression in projects in their Lakota classes, but their passion is larger than that. The absence of music in their education is stark. Many of my students sing in Lakota, rap in English, mimic pop singers, and even ask me to borrow my guitar or keyboard. They dream of learning music not just as a way to develop talent and pursue their goals, but also to help their intellectual development and to live a fuller life. \r\\n\r\\nI am designing an after-school music program to compensate for its absence in their school day. I am using the Massachusetts state standards for music grades k-8, which are the same standards that I was taught growing up there. The 5 strands I will be teaching are Singing, Reading\/Notation, Instruments, Improvisation\/Composition, and Critical Response. Music education must be experiential, and so my students will use the requested resources in the pursuit of concrete standards and learning goals. We will begin the year developing a thorough understanding and mastery of rhythm. My students will use glockenspiels to combine their rhythmic skills with melodic and harmonic skills. They will use their recorders to develop instrument skills such as air support and expression. Both the recorders and glockenspiels will be used to develop listening-answering skills and familiarity with musical notation. At the end of the year students will compose and perform an original and collaborative song. \r\\n\r\\nOur staff and administration is working as hard as they can for student achievement and to raise our test scores. The Arts are considered extra to successful testing, so they are the first casualties of a struggling school. However, without a music education, my students cannot close the achievement gap: they deserve every opportunity their higher-performing peers have, and with the generous support from donors like you, they can get it.

I am making it my personal goal to have all of my students look at writing as a tool needed for success! \r\\n\r\\nI have the students, now I just need the supplies. The supplies listed will allow students to practice and develop their writing skills. I hope this writing center will be enjoyable and educational for all of my students. In order to meet my goal, I am asking for items such as paper, alphabet stamps, chalk, markers and a chart stand. The materials requested will allow students to practice their writing skills. I will allow students the opportunity to use this writing center daily during Language Arts time. \r\\n\r\\nThe first assignment in this center will be to stamp out all of the alphabet letters and then copy them with a pencil or marker. By the end of the school year, I hope to see fantastic stories coming out of this center. \r\\n\r\\nBy donating the materials I have requested, you are giving my students a chance to develop a skill that they will use for the rest of their lives. Thank you so much!\""}

{"essay":"\"\"\"The more you read, the more things you know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.\"\"-Dr.Seuss. In order for my students to have the opportunity to go more places, I am faced with the challenge of getting them ready for the future in technology while teaching them the basics in reading. \r\\n\r\\nEach day I have the pleasure and responsibility for getting 19 first graders ready for their future of learning.  We are a Title 1 school, a school with a high percentage of students that are of low socio-economic status. My class consists of several advanced readers, reading on second and even third grade reading levels, as well as others who are still emergent readers that struggle with basic sight words.  Of these 19 students, three are English Language Learners.  Since we are a Title 1 school, many of our students do not have access to the latest technology at home.  Providing students with a variety of tools at school, including  computers and iPads, will greatly enhance their reading abilities because it will allow me to customize instruction to meet their needs. The iPad mini will allow students to work in small groups on programs customized to meet their needs, whether that is remediation or extension activities.  \r\\n\r\\nThe use of an iPad mini would be a great educational instrument in the classroom because it would reach the diverse learning community of my students. My struggling readers would have the opportunity to read along with stories while building their vocabulary and confidence. Using the iPad mini with my advanced learners would stimulate higher level thinking and increase the rigor in their reading and writing. It would be an exciting and engaging way to motivate students with new ideas and exploration.  It could meet the needs of each individual, allowing for re-teaching and practicing skills, as well as providing enrichment opportunities.\r\\n \r\\n\r\\nBy choosing to support this project, you will be providing my students with the opportunity to develop their reading capabilities in a manner that allows them to feel successful while fostering independence and self-confidence.  With your help, we can instill a love of learning that will encourage my students to become lifelong learners and build a foundation of academic success. \""}
{"essay":"\"Reading was my favorite thing in school.  I could not put a book down.  Reading is NOT my students favorite thing. E-books have revolutionized reading.

They enjoy being busy and are very social.  The school they attend is a large public school in a an area just outside of the metropolitan city.  The students are active in sports and music.  Our campus tries to provide ways to encourage students to try new things.  The students have set goals and most of them plan to attend college.  Our students enjoy learning, however learning is changing with the use of technology and how they interact with technology. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are just like students everywhere.  They want to learn and do their best, however, many struggle with reading.  Our school has begun to purchase e-books.  They are wonderful, however we need the devices to allow our students access.  The e-books have the ability to read to students, which would help the struggling readers keep up with classmates.  Another feature of many of the e-books is the ability to take notes.  It is important to work with students early in learning the skill to take notes.  I selected an iPad rather than a e-reader, so that my students would also have access to learning apps to extend their learning.  The ipad also has wifi, which would enable the students to access other on-line resources to support the learning in my classroom.  It is important for me to show students how to appropriate use technology - both hardware and the software available.  The ipads will enable my students to use technology to improve their future. \r\\n\r\\nThis project is very important to me.  I want my students to experience the love of reading that I have.  But traditional books are often not motivating to digital natives.  Having access in my classroom on devices for my students will help us develop a love for reading using the e-books on the ipads.  Being able to other things on the devices will make my classroom soar.  My students will learn to appreciate and use technology wisely. \""}

We are a college prep middle school, meaning we believe that children have the skills to make it through college. We have college banners, assemblies, and drive home the principle of work effort and ethics. My school site is also special because we believe in literacy. we have a designated 45 minutes of sustained silent reading in every classroom each morning.

{"essay":"\"On June 26, 2003 I will conclude my first year as a third grade teacher in P.S. 13 of East New York Brooklyn.  I have learned many things during this past year and have tried to teach all of my students not only the lessons in math, literacy, science, and social studies that are required by the state, but I have also attempted to teach them many essential life lessons.  P.S. 13 is located in a very poor neighborhood where many of the children arrive for school each morning with very little motivation, a great deal of attitude, low self-esteem, and almost no emotional resources with which to deal with their personal and familial problems.  Therefore, I have tried to tackle some of these issues within my classroom community.  One of the ways in which I have tried to deal with important topics has been through our weekly list of spellings words.  This was a tradition that I remembered from my own days in the NYC public schools, and adapted as a routine in my own classroom.  The words began as a very simple list of four or five letter words; however, as I became familiar with the issues that permeated the school and the neighborhood the list took on a life of its own.  I began to use the weekly spelling words as a medium of social change.  Whenever I noticed a problem in the classroom that called for serious attention the next week's words would address that problem directly.  So my words went from \"\"glass, class, party, and school\"\" to \"\"excellence, mediocrity, choice, education, respect.\"\"  And through our discussions of the spelling words and the activities linked to them throughout the week my kids and I delved into many difficult topics in hopes of improving ourselves and our community.  The major problem I came across however was that none of the children had dictionaries that contained these words.  So I had to provide all the definitions myself, and after a while the children thought I was making up all the words.  So my request would be to have a set of dictionaries in my classroom so that the students can learn to use the dictionary, can learn to include these words in their every-day vocabulary, and can improve their literacy skills.  But most of all, I want them to believe in these words, and to understand that they are much more than a list at the beginning of each week; they are lessons that will help with their life choices, thereby bettering their life experiences. \r\\n\""}

We have been on school improvement for not meeting annual yearly progress, and are continuing to strive to best meet the needs of our students.  Professional development for teachers is important to help our students be successful in school. There are several issues that we deal with as a result of teaching in a poverty area. We strive to help our students be successful in learning. \r\\n\r\\nAs a result of  having the two iPads in the library, I feel I would be better able to provide differentiated instruction to all my students. I serve special education students, such as Autistic children, and know that using an iPad is especially valuable in their learning, and there has been research to prove this. I have found many apps that provide library skills that the students could benefit from when using an iPad. \r\\n\r\\nI plan to set up centers of differentiated instruction including covering Common Core standards.  I plan to have an iPad center where students can go on apps to learn about library skills, and  find, read, and write about valid information. This is a very important skill for students to have. Technology is ever changing, and I believe it is our job to show kids internet safety. They need to be able to find valid information, because not everything on the internet is valid. They must be higher level thinkers so they make good decisions both now and in their future. \r\\n\r\\nMy overall goal is to have students see success, learn and grow.  I believe that success breeds success, and providing differentiated instruction with the iPads would greatly help all students feel successful in school.  \r\\nThe library is a wonderful place for students to gain confidence in reading, finding and writing about valid information, and ultimately provide students with the confidence to contribute to a global society both now and in the future! \""}

Do you remember not wanting to put your book down. Help me get my students excited about reading! Let's give them the possibility of hundreds of books at their fingertips.\r\\n\r\\nMy public K-5 elementary school is located in the suburbs of Tampa, Florida; where I teach a wonderful blended class of 4th grade students. Currently, my rosters includes students with Learning Disabilities, students at-risk, economically disadvantaged, and English Language Learners. \r\\n\r\\nMy students enjoy having stories read to them, listening to their favorite stories on CD, and even sharing the stories that they write.  However, the idea of independent reading does not excite many of them as much.  For some it is because they cannot find a book that interests them, for others sitting and reading seems boring. Please help me make them look forward to independent reading again! Please help them bring back their love of Reading! \r\\n\r\\nI am asking for two Barnes and Noble Nooks. The Nooks  will allow my students access to thousands of books. Research has shown that students gain a love of reading by having access to the genre, authors, and titles that they enjoy most. These titles are not always available in our classroom library or school media center. The Nooks will allow us to easily acquire books that interest them right from our classroom. \r\\n\r\\nIt is also important for students to have access and learn how to use new technology. The students will be able to use the Nooks during our Independent Reading Time. They will be able to sit and read a book from the Nook. The Nooks will also help during our instructional reading time. If we are reading an author we like or studying an interesting topic we will be able to look up books to extend our learning.  I can then share these books with the class \r\\n\r\\nI believe this project will create a positive impact on my students by opening them up to a world of new books.

These cushions allow them to get the movement they need, while still sitting in the classroom chair during activities.  This will give them opportunities to focus on what is being presented to them, as opposed to them needing to stand up and move around the classroom.\r\\n\r\\nThe various materials that have been chosen in this project will help my students get excited about experiencing something new!  They seem to be getting bored using the same toys all the time.  It would be great to get them interested in something new!  While they have fun with the magnets, puzzles, cubes, wikki stix, and balls, they will be learning about colors, counting, and shapes.  In addition, they will be practicing eye-hand coordination, matching, use of the small muscles in their hands and fingers, and strengthening their muscles. \r\\n\r\\nMost of us do not think about how difficult it may be to learn how to pick up a paperclip, use a clothespin, or to match shapes. For my students with special needs, these are tasks that can be extremely challenging and need to be practiced on a daily basis.  \r\\n\r\\nPlease help my students by providing them with various opportunities to learn these basic skills. Being able to master these skills will impact their lives forever.  Your donation will be helping children who walk in my classroom for years to come. \""}

{"essay":"\"I am writing to ask for basic PE equipment for our school. We are a relatively new charter school that has been built in the very crowded streets of downtown L.A. We are very limited for space and the play area that we have is very small. I am the P.E. teacher and I am given very little equipment. The equipment I use is shared throughout the entire school from Kindergarten - 8th grade (approx.600 students) outside of my regular physical education classes. So this would mean for recess, lunch recess, and for teachers to use for their classes. Because of this there is a real shortage of equipment. Sometimes I am not able to teach certain classes because some teachers have kept certain materials in their class, so when I go to teach a class my materials are missing. Also the wear and tear on material that is used everyday for ten months straight can be real terrible. We find that by the end of the year the equipment is in such bad shape that it is either not able to be used for the next year or it has only a very short life span left. I believe if I were able to get more equipment into the school then this would definitely help the situation. Also with the new equipment, I believe that it would be a lot easier to share since there would be more of everything versus trying to juggle very limited materials throughout the P.E. program and a whole school. I would like to know that the program that I am running is a strong solid program and not one that is limited to the material that I don't have.  Please join in and help contribute to the future of many children. I believe with all of the problems that we face with obesity in children and lack of proper nutrition today in America, that P.E. should not only be fun but it is also detrimental in helping to live healthy lives. This is why I am also asking for nutrition awareness materials. This way I can also teach the children how to be aware of what they are eating and also giving them the understanding on a grass roots level of what nutrition really is. By having a better understanding for their health and nutrition I believe that this will not only help the children, but it will also help the parents. The children can educate parents on what should be and what should not be consumed on a daily basis. So with these materials we won't only be helping students but we'll be helping entire families.

In order to teach my students how to prepare simple foods we will set aside a time weekly to prepare a breakfast or lunch. We will invite others, either teachers,other classes,or parents to eat with us at times. We will learn to set the table properly as well as serve others at the table.

{"essay":"\"Have you ever seen something that captured your attention so much that you have not forgotten it to this day? Most of us have. Imagine the impact the right visual images could have on student achievement for a classroom of emergent readers and mathematicians. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are facing serious challenges. As 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, most have reading levels 3-4 years below their grade level. Many are lacking in the most fundamental math skills and knowledge. They are so eager to learn these things! Now is the time to make them successful and on the path to college.\r\\n\r\\nThe best way to do this is to engage all students in learning, and I am requesting the digital projector to help me do so the best I can. Although I believe that all students should receive instruction in all modalities of learning (traditionally visual, auditory, kinesthetic), visual learning is central to how most of my students learn best. However, without any sort of projector I am often left bumbling through lessons on the board trying to create compelling visuals. Even well-planned, I currently do not have a better way to execute them in class. My students deserve better. \r\\n\r\\nThis year, I have received fewer curricular materials than in the past, both in Reading and Language Arts and in Math, due to continuing budget cuts. Providing students with the resources to see skills in action and emulate them is key to their success, and a projector is one of the best ways to do that given limited resources. A projector also allows for greater differentiation and engagement through whole-class or small-group discussion. From demonstrations and presentations to practice, discussion, and evaluation, this projector will help me be more effective in making students learn.\r\\n \r\\n\r\\nThis project will have a dramatic impact on student achievement, setting 4th, 5th, and 6th graders on a successful path to college. Lessons will reach visual learners in a way that is clear and effective, leading to greater engagement overall. Students will be pushed to discuss and defend their ideas, allowing for differentiation and higher-levels of thinking. The projector can also effectively display practice exercises, allowing students the practice they need to master skills. Thank you!\""}

For those who do not know what a document camera is, it is camera that hooks up to a projector or to a computer that allows a book, a document, or even a 3-D object to be projected onto a large screen. It has many advantages over an overhead projector because documents or books first do not have to be photocopied onto plastic transparencies. A full-color book can be placed under the camera and projected for the whole class to see at once, therefore allowing students to practice reading a text together. A sample of a student's writing can be projected so that students can discuss the editing process together and help proofread each others' work. 3-D images, such as science materials or math manipulatives, can be shown to students while the teacher models how to use them. This is especially important when there is only one copy of an object or when students need to be shown how to do something before they are able to do it on their own. \r\\n\r\\nThe only way to become proficient at a language is to practice, practice, practice it with others! A document camera will allow students to read books aloud together when there is only one copy and to point out features of the text for everyone to see at once. It will also allow students to share and discuss their writing with others. Students learn by explaining their thinking and their examples to others. A document camera will make practicing English easier! \""}

{"essay":"\"It's hard to hold your music and play your instrument at the same time.  That's why our new instrumental program needs a set of music stands so that scholars can learn how to play their instrument and read music at the same time. \r\\n\r\\nOur school is a public charter school that opened in the Fall of 2010 with approximately 70 students. We are continuing to grow as we add a new grade level each school year. This year, we serve approximately 230 students in grades K - 3. Our school qualifies for Title I funds due to the economic status of our student population.\r\\n\r\\nWe are a college preparatory elementary school. At our school, all students are called \"\"scholars\"\" because each and every one is a scholar and will one day go to and graduate from college. We believe strongly in providing our young scholars whatever they need to make it to their college graduation; that includes a strong education in reading, writing, math, social studies, science, the arts and character. \r\\n\r\\nOur scholars are eager learners who constantly push themselves to reach their full potential along their path to college graduation. \r\\n\r\\nOur instrumental program is new this year.  Currently we are in need of 18 music stands for our scholars to use during class.\r\\n\r\\nMusic stands are essential for developing musical literacy skills in an instrumental class.  Music stands allow the scholars to have their printed music at the perfect height and angle so that they do not have to strain to see it. \r\\n\r\\nThe 18 music stands I'm requesting will serve two separate 3rd grade instrumental classes of approximately 30 scholars each.  In the coming years, the program will grow to 4th and 5th grade as our school adds those grades.  By Fall 2015, these stands will be used by almost 180 scholars in 3rd through 5th grade. \r\\n\r\\nYour donation will provide our scholars with essential materials- music stands for our instrumental program. Having music stands will assist the scholars who participate in our instrumental program as they develop both music literacy skills and instrumental skills. \""}
{"essay":"\"Do you love a challenge? Well, my 7th graders do. Every year, I introduce them to Greek mythology and the epic hero Odysseus (the ancient world's answer to Batman). They adore the story, so much so, that our books have become dog eared and are falling apart, and my supplies are depleted.   \r\\n\r\\nMy students are a true pleasure to teach. They are mostly latch key kids from working class homes. They want to achieve and they strive for excellence. My students have aspirations of being doctors, athletes, lawyers, agents, and astronauts. They live in  the inner city, but their community is close knit and full of families and young professionals. I know it's a cliche, but they're just plain old fashioned good kids.  They're parents work hard to provide for them, and to make ends meet.  \r\\n\r\\nThese supplies would help my class immeasurably. First, half of my supply of the Odyssey are missing pages, and some students have to share. So, it would greatly aid comprehension for each student to have their own individual book. Secondly, Greek mythology provides the archetype for so many other forms of Western literature. To learn it in middle school lays the ground work for the classics and Shakespearean study in high school and beyond. \r\\n\r\\nMy students also get a huge kick out of reading something that is normally introduced in the 9th grade. Lastly, we map Odysseus' journey and create Greek mythology based board, card and dice games. The art supplies would go a long way to aid in that process.       \r\\n\r\\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my project. You're help in any amount will be more than appreciated.

They will not only be used for sensory or physical achievement, but will also be used for teaching while a student in in the multi-sensory room.  The use of soft sounds and music are good for the thought process and brain function.  Having a place for sand and other tactile items will help students with tactile deficiencies as well as being a relaxation and sensory stimulation for students with sensory deprivation.  Having special lighting and comfortable seating allow students to feel welcomed and calm while in this special space. \r\\n\r\\nThis project will not only help my specific special education students.  It will be a huge asset for our school and all the students that attend.  It will give an opportunity for alternative education to all students who need it.  Education today should be direct and explicit for each and every student.  This type of room will get us just another step closer to ensuring this among all of our students. \""}
{"essay":"\"Without the ability to read, the opportunities for academic success are limited.  Children become frustrated with their inability to read and often act out in the classroom.  As educators, we should make sure that reading is fun and that learning is exciting for students.  \r\\n\r\\nOur school is considered a Special Center within a mid-sized urban school district.  We work with children who are emotionally disturbed and require individualized education plans.  The students are placed in our building because of their behavior in a normal school setting.  \r\\n\r\\nOur building accommodates students from kindergarten to the twelfth grade.  The staff is efficiently trained and dedicated to inspire growth in academics, social and emotional competences.  The general population consists of students with disabilities such as emotionally disturbed, severe depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders and severe attention disorders.  \r\\n\r\\nThese disorders have adversely affected students'\u00c2\u0099 learning progress within the general curriculum.  Academic life is a continuous struggle for many of our students.  Most students live in foster care or live-in group homes.  Many of the students have poor language and reading skills because of their health diagnosis. \r\\n\r\\nThe Nook Simple Device would be used as a motivational tool meant to encourage students to spend more time learning to stay on task during sustained silent reading.  During their designated reading time, students generally must be reminded to select a reading book.  However by using a Nook, students will be more engaged with the technology, which will enhance their desire to read.  \r\\n\r\\nBecause many of my students read below grade level, students would be able to hear the words as well as see the words being read.  This is a more effective approach for these students than using books and tape series that utilize audible beeps to encourage the student to turn the page.  \r\\n\r\\nWith the three Nook Simple Touch devices, the students would be encouraged to sharpen their reading and fluency skills, while advancing their usage of technology.  The Nook'\u00c2\u0099s auto-save feature would allow the student to save his place in the reading selection, which would substantially lower the frustration felt by students that have a tendency to lose their place.\r\\n\r\\nThe Nook Simple Touch device would introduce my students to a wonderful way of honing their reading skills through technology.  It would allow them to be creative and encourage them to find ways to empower themselves.  This tool would allow my students to read a story at their own pace, increase their fluency persistency and encourage higher levels of reading material selection.

{"essay":"\"Do you remember the joy that you experienced when your favorite elementary teacher read a new, exciting, or favorite book aloud?  Well, a listening center can provide that same exciting experience for my students when they are able to hear a narrated audio book read aloud. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are primarily from low income, high poverty homes.  This doesn't make them more entitled to a donation from you, but the struggles they face everyday certainly sets them apart from children in more affluent schools. Our school is a large elementary school, but we are very much a family and we celebrate the successes of one another daily.  \r\\nUnderstanding that my students are from low socioeconomic homes should not in any way lead you to think that my students are less capable, less enthusiastic, or less loved than students from middle or high income families.  In fact, if you could watch these children, you'd be amazed at what they overcome and go on to accomplish every single day.  I am so grateful to be a part of their lives, and I hope to provide them with tools at school that they may otherwise not have available to them.    \r\\n\r\\nI have grand plans for my classroom for the coming school year and will be incorporating several new ideas.  The first of which, I am appealing for here, to you.  I plan to install a Listening Lounge...think of a breakfast bar with a counter and stools and you get the idea.  Each child will have a stool, and an area at the counter.  Wireless headphones will enable 6 of my students to listen to the same story at one time!  Better yet, there will be no messy, constantly tangled cord, stretched to the limit from the small cassette player perched precariously nearby.  No more tug of war over cords, and the most comfortable headset, no more stopping small group lessons to go referee the listening center!  Oh, the joy!\r\\nListening to books on audio provides students with an opportunity to hear a book recorded by an animated narrator with fun voices and sound effects.  It helps a child to see the words on the page come alive with the telling of the story.  What could be more perfect? \r\\n\r\\nYour donation will help to make this vision actually come to reality for the students in my classroom.  Hearing their favorite stories, told by the author as it was intended is a treat in and of itself, but to do so with ease, using a new wireless headphone set would be a dream come true.  Finally, a solution to problematic cords, and the ability to concentrate on an exciting tale told aloud!  Thank you for your support!  My students and I appreciate you! \""}

{"essay":"\"As a bilingual teacher, I know that my students are very smart.  They are capable of learning concepts and building on their knowledge of English at the same time.

My students are 100% Hispanic, and the majority are English Language Learners.  Both of the subjects I teach are taught in English.  However, the language barrier is a challenge for many of the students, most of who come from a home where Spanish is the language spoken.  They work very hard and are motivated to reach the coveted status of Star Students each year, and they deserve to receive the best education possible. \r\\n\r\\nThe biggest challenge that I face in ensuring that my students get the education they deserve is my board.  The chalkboard I have in my classroom is old and peeling, so it is difficult to read what is written on it.  A whiteboard would solve many of the difficulties I face in teaching my students by allowing me to make my lessons more interactive and comprehensible.  Whiteboards have many advantages.  First, colors are very easily visible on its smooth surface; teachers can differentiate between concepts and ideas, and highlight certain points easily.  Second, whiteboards are magnetic, allowing me to design activities where students can come up to the board and manipulate objects. Lastly, I have an ELMO projector, and if I had a whiteboard I could project onto it. This would allow for bigger and clearer images than I currently project (onto a screen), and both students and I could fill in answers right on the board! \r\\n\r\\nI love to plan lessons that I know are going to be interactive and comprehensible because those are the lessons in which my students truly learn and I know I have done my job.  The largest limitation in my classroom is the lack of a whiteboard, and while I do my best to not let this challenge affect the level of learning in my classroom, your help in obtaining a whiteboard would increase student learning and achievement dramatically. \""}

{"essay":"\"Have you ever experienced \u201ctrue\u201d hunger where your body had a total lack of nutrients needed for the maintenance of life? Real hunger is not often experienced in our modern, overfed population, but within our school community poverty exists that does not allow all individuals the luxury of having adequate food on a daily basis.  \r\\n\r\\nOur students attend an 80.2% generational poverty public school in rural South Carolina. The lives of our students are often very different from those of their more affluent peers. They cannot look forward to an abundance of presents on their birthday. Back-to-school shopping is not an exciting time of new clothes and school supplies. Even small outlays of money are significant to our students; a locker fee, a soft drink for a class party, or a fee for a field trip may be out of their reach. In addition, because they do not wear the same fashionable clothes as their peers, they may become the targets of ridicule. Our economically disadvantaged students have a very difficult time with succeeding in school. One of the most unfortunate results of our students\u2019 economic struggles is that they too often drop out of school to get a job to help their family make ends meet, to put food on the table, thus forgoing a higher education experience that could in the long term enrich their futures.  \r\\n\r\\nWith the ceramic art resources, HOPE (Healing Out Planet Earth) Club students\u2019 will create one-of-a-kind bowls that will be auctioned off at a Spaghetti Dinner fundraiser whose proceeds will be donated to our local food kitchen where many of our students go with their families on a nightly basis to eat when they are unable to put food on their own table at home. Under-nutrition increases how often and how long a child may be sick. In addition to being absent from school, illness limits learning as sick children do not interact well with others. Under-nourished children lack things that make healthy children successful. Poorly nourished children tend to be less physically active, less curious, less attentive, less independent, less responsive socially, and more anxious. These traits keep them from developing reading, verbal, and physical skills, among others. Iron deficiency and anemia occur among large numbers of children. Anemic children do not do well on math, reading, vocabulary, problem-solving, or psychological tests. Even mild iron deficiency causes fatigue and a shortened attention span. Feeling hungry, perhaps from missed meals, affects learning. Hungry children tend to be irritable, disinterested in learning, nervous, timid passive, and unable to concentrate. By making and auctioning the bowls along with our dinner fundraiser, HOPE Club students will be helping to lessen these effects of hunger on our overall student population. \r\\n\r\\nIf you've ever been stuck at work, stomach rumbling from hunger, you know how difficult it can be to concentrate on the task in front of you. You might feel tired, sluggish and even a little irritable. As a consequence, you're probably not able to perform to the best of your ability. Now imagine you're a child who had to go to school without breakfast because your parents didn't have enough money to feed you.

Our school has a high poverty rate and continues to push our students to achieve their highest potential.  Last year, our school grew over 25 points, through after school tutoring, enrichment programs, Saturday tutoring, and pure dedication by the students and teachers. \r\\n\r\\nCommon Core Standards require students to do research and publish various products (bookmarks, reports, letters etc.) to demonstrate knowledge of materials taught.  My classroom has two computers that are over 10 years old and have a difficult time keeping them running.

{"essay":"\"\"\"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.\"\" -Dr. Seuss\r\\nMy classroom is a lively, active, engaging place where students grow together. I want my students to love learning, which comes from reading. These books will aid in that process. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are a magnificent group of kindergarten kiddos. I currently have 14 boys and 9 girls in my room, which makes for an active day! They truly love listening to stories that exercise their imagination, and they always have an opinion to share. The students in my classroom are predominantly Hispanic or black. Half of my class is seen for English Language Learner (ELL) assistance.  My school is in a less affluent area of town, which presents challenges of its own. My school has 100% free and reduced price lunch, which means all of the students here receive free breakfasts and lunches. The teachers at this school are wonderful-loving, kind, and most of all, caring. We build a sense of responsibility, respectfulness, and pride in our students, because we want them to make a difference in this world.  \r\\n\r\\nWith these requested books in our classroom, we can build many kindergarten skills. Dr. Seuss books not only greatly improve rhyme recognition, but are recognized as great 'Early Reader' books. This means that there is an easy reading pattern or word pattern, and that kids can easily sound out most of the words. Rhyme recognition is challenging among the majority of our ELL students, and having books like this to read and listen to really helps them build the connection between words. 'There was an old lady who swallowed...' books also reinforce the rhyming skill. Additionally, students can use their prediction skills to guess what might happen next, which is a kindergarten skill.  Skippyjon Jones books help with rhyming as well, but, more than that, they teach the children that using your imagination and dreaming big is a great thing! You do not have to be what everyone around you is- break out! I love this lesson for my kiddos. \r\\n \r\\n\r\\nDonations to this project will make a huge difference to me and my kindergarten kids. Most of the students in my class do not have books at home- they rely solely on library books and the books I read to them at school. To have access to these popular and creative books would mean that I have more resources to help explain or further classroom concepts, and this would give the kids one more way of learning.  \""}
{"essay":"\"\"\"What do you mean you can't find anything to do for the Science Fair, \"\" I say to some glum, discouraged students.  With a fresh supply of books I think these 550 middle school children will be inspired to  try their best at any science project.  Science is part of their lives, here and at home. \r\\n\r\\nAs our picture shows we are a lively and fun bunch.  We are not afraid to compete with the world when it comes to science.  We just need some tools with which to work.  Our current enrollment is 564 students.  We have 212 students  in the 6th grade, 187 in the 7th grade, and 167 in the eighth grade.  We have 68% of students who get free or reduced lunch.  Fifty percent are white, 41% are African-American, 1% Asian, 7% HIspanic, 1% is Other.  Thirteen percent are in  Exceptional Child Education. Students in all grades and levels need to explain changes and consequences in ecosystems, which includes chemical interactions, force and motion, macro\/micro organisms, earth science and light.  We think the students can demonstrate their enhanced  ability in the science fair  to show and share their mastery of these concepts.   We hope that the benefits of this grant help the students  experience success by developing learning, thinking and life skills on a daily basis. \r\\n\r\\nWe want our students to understand scientific ways of thinking and working and to use those methods to solve real-life problems.\r\\nWith this selection of books, ranging from the galaxies to microbiology to plate tectonics to various biomes, I think we can capture our science students' attention.  A, a 13 year old 7th grader, said he really likes science, \"\"Because it gives me an idea of what stuff has particles and elements in it.\"\"  A. said he wants to learn about ecosystems like what's in the stuff of everyday life like ink in pens.\"\"  He said he would like to use the books on fossil fuels, lakes and wetlands, biomes and ecosystems.  C., a 7th grader, said she would enjoy the book, The Sun, Stars, and Galaxies.  This year for her science project she worked on Sky in a Jar using a mixture of light, water and milk.  Next year  she wants to build a telescope.  M., 12 years old, said she likes studying about the human body.  The book, A Closer Look at Biology and Cells would interest her. \r\\n\r\\nScientific thought  should not be an abstract notion to be taken out for a review occasionally.  We  want to promote the scientific method through research and experiments.  We want our students to experience the role of the scientist  everyday. . One of our 6th graders, J, said, \"\"When I was younger I wanted to make chemicals-things I would find around the house to see what happens mostly.\"\"   This kind of inquiry of a little boy should be the norm for most students.  These books would help. \""}

The school I'm at is a highly supportive environment of compassionate individuals and a forward thinking administration, which is a culture created from the top down at a district level. However, like any school anywhere, there will always be students who, for a variety of reasons, struggle to keep pace and meet instructional standards. \r\\n\r\\nAdditionally, of the two middle schools in our district, the one I teach at has a significantly higher population of students receiving free or reduced lunch. With this being the case, relying upon students as a whole to come to class with all necessary materials on a daily basis, let alone materials such as headphones that wouldn't traditionally be thought of as 'school supplies,' is not a sustainable practice. \r\\n\r\\nMy students will use these headphones daily to access instructional materials, tutorials and examples through a series of 'learning paths' I've created using a website called Keiro. Through these learning paths, students will learn the foundations of literary analysis. They will learn concepts, skills and strategies aligned with the Common Core Standards within a structured online environment which I construct and oversee. Having these headphones in place means every student, every day, will have complete access to the all of the content on the site, even if they forgot their own headphones that day. All too often the same students who come to class unprepared are the same students who can't afford to miss a moment of instructional time within the classroom setting. These headphones will close that gap and create a level playing field for all students in my room, no matter what their life is like outside the doors of my class. \r\\n\r\\nBy giving students access to a variety of instructional videos either created or curated by myself, students progress through structured, incremental steps on their learning path with the opportunity to not only self pace their instruction, but also review material as necessary.

As I selected books for this project, I had specific students in mind who I thought might enjoy the books. I have a very diverse classroom full of students of many different races and languages and it's sometimes difficult to find high interest books with minority characters. I know the power that reading a book with characters who look and talk like you can have on a child, which is why my focus was on finding good quality books featuring African American and Latino characters that my students would be excited about. \r\\n\r\\nWe are also in desperate need of new bookcases and storage for our classroom. New furniture in classrooms at my school is unheard of. I have been teaching in the same classroom for 7 years and a lot of my furniture is potentially older than I am!

We are a small school of 130 students in grades Pre-K through 8. In the middle school, we have three classes, one of six graders, one of seventh, and finally our eighth grade class. These classes are small and contain anywhere from 9 to 15 students. My students are eager to learn and eager to develop their young minds and be the best that they can be. With your help, I believe that our students can reach their goals and accomplish their dreams.  \r\\n\r\\nMy students will always have colds, sniffles, runny noses, and little bugs that just won't go away. My students need tissues and hand sanitizer to help combat these colds and to be able to attend school even when they have the sniffles. If the students do not have access to tissues in the classroom, they will constantly have to run to the bathroom, missing valuable class time. \r\\n\r\\nBy including paper towels in with this order, my students will be able to complete the projects that my previous orders were designed for. My classroom has several sinks in it and paper towels provide you with a resource to clean up after the projects have been completed. \r\\n\r\\nBy making this donation, you will provide my students with essentials that we take for granted in every day life!  \r\\n\r\\nBy your generous hand, my students will have clean hands, clean noses, and paper towels to help clean the classroom.

Throughout the last year, I have seen the gross motor skills of my students improve where they are hopping, skipping, jumping, kicking and catching balls, and tossing balls into the basket with confidence. \r\\n\r\\nUnfortunately, I do not have enough balls to distribute for each of my students. I would love to give my students the opportunity to choose from a variety of gym equipment so they may try all sports. The short time that my students have in the school playground is also probably the only chance that they have for physical, active exercise throughout the day or even week. I would like to introduce to my students the different types of play with balls and afford them the opportunity to experience these activities.\r\\nMost importantly, I want to teach my students the importance of exercise and fitness. In recent years, childhood obesity and inactivity have been growing. The best place to stop it is in school through hands-on experience of sports activities. School is sometimes the only place where students can get physical activity. \r\\n\r\\nI would like to provide enough balls to my students to help promote their gross motor skills, advance their hand and eye coordination and most importantly build up their self confidence. Research also shows that physical activities will also increase their concentration in their academics.\r\\nThese balls and bean bags are great for my young students. They are soft so they won't hurt themselves or each other. They are big enough for each student to pass, throw or toss to each other. The bean bag dolls will give my students something to play catch with in the classroom. They can catch colorful animal bean bags and not have to worry about it breaking something. These are very helpful on rainy, cold, snowy days that will soon hit us. The 2 tunnels will help to let them crawl and create an obstacle course in the classroom. The 2 parachutes will help them learn cooperation as they toss the bean bag animals and balls into the air. \r\\n\r\\nI believe that given the opportunity, my students can accomplish anything they can try, all they need is help getting that start. We can also help stop childhood obesity by re-introducing sports and other active physical activities to young children. Their gross motor skills can be greatly improved while having fun. Your help can greatly increase their gross motor skills, while also improving their self-confidence and in the long run, their academic abilities in school. \""}

{"essay":"\"Can you guess what this statistic is describing: 1 out of every 94 children.  This is the current number of children who are autistic.  This number has gone from 1 out of 150 to 1 out of 94 within a relatively short period of time. With such an alarming rate of incidences schools have seen a spike in the number of students with autism.  \r\\nI am currently an elementary autism teacher.  I have 8 students in second through forth grades, all of which have a primary diagnosis of autism.  My school is unique because my school only serves students with disabilities.  We have around 55 students total which makes our school feel more like a family.  The environment we provide our students is one of acceptance, encouragement, and belonging.  \r\\n \r\\n\r\\nLike many teachers, I do not have the monies available to purchase necessary items for my students.  The students I have cannot yet function in a \"\"regular\"\" school, even with supports, so they are bussed to my building from 10 different school districts.  Since my school is a separate facility the staff does not have the type of access to vital, every-day items like computer printers and speakers, technology and media like teachers in a general education classroom in a general education building have.  We do not have a computer lab, a library or other items that most teachers take for granted.    Autism is a unique disorder in that it varies greatly from person to person and my classroom is a wonderful example of this.  I have students functioning at an 18-month level and some functioning close to their grade level.  Because of this I often find myself having to create classroom materials to meet the needs of all of my students.  This does become a frustrating endeavor because I do not usually have the supplies I need to do this effectively.  My supplies usually are hand-me-downs from various schools that we serve and are typically out dated. Although I am grateful for whatever supplies I receive, \r\\n\r\\nI am requesting some science items that will help my students, not only learn about butterflies, but to learn about nature and how delicate our environment is.  My students are all autistic and need to be taught using all of their senses but respond well to visual stimuli.   I think it would be an awesome class project to have a butterfly kit in our room.  The kit comes with live caterpillars that we would raise and watch them go though the life cycle.  When they are butterflies and ready to be released we would have a \u201cbutterfly party\u201d.  This is an activity the enter school could participate in.  Along with the live butterflies, also would like some supplemental activities such as using stamps and puzzles to depict the life cycle of butterflies and other insects, a set of 8 classroom easy readers with wonderful illustrations, a stuffed animal that starts out as a caterpillar and then transforms into a butterfly (my students LOVE stuffed animals) and a board game that helps teach basic language skills.   I also included a HP digital camera.  As I stated earlier, my students need and respond to visual stimuli.  I would like to have them go outside and take pictures with the camera.

All of us look out for each other in my building.  Think of what type of pictures could be taken through the eyes of a child with autism; the possibilities are endless.

{"essay":"\"My school is in a rural community with a greatly diverse population many of which qualify for free or reduced lunches.  I am the literacy coach for the primary grades and, per the directions of my principal, am working with these teachers to improve math instruction through the use of manipulatives and incorporation of literacy skills.\r\\n\r\\nWe have found that math achievement in higher grades improves when there is an emphasis on hands-on instruction in math tied to literacy skills in the primary grades.  Students in primary classes are most likely to be concrete operational learners and therefore need a variety of hands-on materials with which to understand the often abstract objectives presented in math and literacy.  We are offering the teachers one unit of renewal credit this year in a course where they learn to teach math with manipulatives, stress literacy through word problems and make lessons accordingly.  \r\\n\r\\nLike most public schools, our funding has been reduced in recent years and most drastically this school year.  In order for us to meet the needs of our students, we must increase our supplies of manipulatives for each grade.  These will provide entire classes the chance to learn through active participation and the ability to see these concepts tangibly. \r\\n\r\\nThe resources we need include: graphing paper, write-wipe lapboards, double sided counters, solid shapes, magnetic wands and tangram sets.  Added to the materials we have and the teacher-made items, we can have a successful year where students' test scores rise but more importantly their understanding of math concepts and literacy skills improve.  You can make this happen with your gracious gift.  Thank you, in advance, for your generosity.\""}

A significant portion of my students (50%) read three to four years below grade level. Most of my students have never truly owned a book, and they have little to no interest in reading as they feel they are not good at it. Our classroom readers are filled with dated short stories that my students cannot relate to and are completely out of their reach in terms of readability.\r\\n\r\\nYou should know, however, that my students have grown tremendously throughout the year. I worked with them through seventh grade, and on average, my students' vocabulary grew 2 grade levels in the one year I worked with them in seventh grade. I have received special permission to travel with my students to eighth grade in hopes that they can continue the incredible growth they began in seventh grade.\r\\n\r\\nI want to plan my lessons around books that will not only challenge my students but offer them the opportunity to truly connect with a book. I specifically want \"\"Chew on This\"\" because obesity and diabetes is a huge problem in the community in which I teach. Many of my students exist solely on fast food, and we all know this has dire health consequences. This book presents the history and consequences of fast food in an entertaining way. My students desperately need practice with non-fiction, and this book would provide them an opportunity to read a non-fiction book that could actually have a big effect on their lives in terms of their health. I am requesting a class set of these books in hopes of using them as part of my curriculum in the coming year. \r\\n\r\\nI am inviting you to be a part of a meaningful change in my students' lives. They desperately need an opportunity to experience the power that comes from reading. There is no one skill that can determine a child's future more than their reading ability, and my students' reading abilities lag incredibly far behind. With your help, their life opportunities and trajectory could drastically change.\""}
{"essay":"\"Do you remember the excitement in science class on the days when you got to do a lab instead of worksheets? My students know, love, and embrace that excitement. But without hot plates, our lab activities are limited. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are between 16 and 21 years old. Approximately 20% have IEPs requiring modifications to their work. They have had bad experiences in schools before, but my students are not quitters. The regular education system has forgotten them and they are coming back to school at an alternative high school. The school is an inner-city school and the students come from low socioeconomic status. The school is relatively new and serves 60-90 students in the regular academic year. Its mission is to create an environment in which teens who have dropped out of high school can come back and earn their diploma. \r\\n\r\\nI am requesting hot plates for my science classes. Labs in the past that we have done have required very simple experiments since we do not have the ability right now to heat our solutions. The different lab activities that will become available to my students are endless. For example, just the simple act of heating ice water until it boils and measuring the temperature teaches students the relationship between kinetic and potential energy and phase changes. Without hot plates, the students will not be able to see this relationship in their graph because they will not be able to make water boil. Something as simple as this experiment would greatly enrich my students ability to understand difficult chemistry concepts. Just imagine what more complicated experiments could do for them. \r\\n\r\\nThe addition of hot plates to their lab equipment opens a world of possibilities for my students. Through these possibilities they will be challenged at individual levels, engaged in labs of interest, and prepared for experiences they will encounter in their futures. \""}
{"essay":"\"After three years, my electric pencil sharpener is ready to be put out to pasture.  Each day 6 classes of students grind away, and unfortunately, no longer walk away with a completely sharpened pencil.  Some have resorted to the small individual sharpeners, but this means pencil shavings everywhere! \r\\n\r\\nI teach sixth grade students at a magnet school in a large urban area.  Many of my students qualify for free-lunch, so we must provide many of the basic supplies for them.  This is a humanities magnet, so the students do many projects that require writing and drawing. \r\\n\r\\nMy students need lots and lots and lots of pencils, but most of all, they need a sharpener that actually sharpens them instead of just wearing them down! At the present time, my students are constantly frustrated with our old malfunctioning pencil sharpener.  We waste time twisting the pencils around to try and get a point 360 degrees around the pencil.  It rarely sharpens the colored pencils enough. Students have been resorting to small individual sharpeners, but the inside of desks and the floor ends up full of pencil shavings.  I've tried to use lead pencils, but they lead to other frustrations with constantly breaking or running out of lead.  The easy solution for us would be to get a sturdier sharpener. The sharpener requested has the ability to have its insides replaced, so this new sharpener could last for years and years :) \r\\n\r\\nSaving time and energy are essential for a smooth running classroom.  Replacing our sharpener will indeed help our classroom run smoother and stay cleaner.  This particular sharpener says it is good for colored pencils and the insides can be replaced if they become dull.  That means that this sharpener will serve hundreds of students in the years to come, so this will be a gift that keeps on giving year after year. \""}
{"essay":"\"The ability to share critical thinking in a cooperative group setting  is paramount to students becoming independent learners and problem solvers.  A strong literacy focus, with accessible text, enables students to examine issues of historical importance and social justice. \r\\n\r\\nAs I enter my 19th year of teaching, I find myself facing a new group of excited fourth graders.  My students vary widely in interest and skill.  As readers, they have levels ranging from 1.7 to 6.5. My classroom, as well as the entire school community, includes every type of student.  Some students receive support from the resource program while others are identified as GATE.  As a full inclusion site with two special education day classrooms, my school is a place of community, compassion, and learning. \r\\n\r\\nAs we transition to a workshop model through the implementation of Common Core State Standards, I find that I am lacking in the books needed to fully implement a reading program where students are continuously reading in books within their own independent reading levels.  The workshop model also calls for a variety of texts within genres to be used for partner reading and small group work.  This requires multiple copies of selected texts.  I currently do not have enough books.\r\\n\r\\nBy having enough texts available in a variety of levels, my students will be able to read and discuss literature in a book club format.  This will allow them to improve their ability to discuss and analyze characters' motivations and decisions with their peers in a way that is engaging and interesting. Besides building their literacy skills, I hope the availability of high-interest texts will inspire them to develop a life-long love of reading. \r\\n\r\\nThe implementation of Common Core State Standards is an important moment in education.  We are now focusing on the skills necessary to be college and career ready.  Literacy, I believe, provides the venue for students to become critical thinkers and problem solvers. My goal is to add more text, at the appropriate levels, so that I can motivate, inspire, and enable every child to engage with books providing the necessary foundation to become lifelong learners. \""}

{"essay":"\"We have entered the world of \"\"Letterland\"\", but can't maneuver effectively through this imaginary land without some extra resources to help us to do so.\r\\n\r\\nI teach in a Pre-K through 8th grade rural school of 220 students. By covering so many grade spans, we need all the resources that a larger school does to implement programs and teach our curriculum, but we don't get as much funding because of our small student body. Our community has been largely factory and furniture workers - many of whom are currently working less or completely laid off. Our PTA helps out the classroom teachers whenever possible, but their resources are limited due to our size and the unemployment in our area. Whenever our county adopts a new program for implementation, they provide us with the bare necessities for the implementation of the program and expect the schools to pick up the extras, which isn't possible for us. \r\\n\r\\nOur county adopted and mandated that we implement a new phonics program entitled \"\"Letterland\"\" for Kindergarten and First Grade this year and will add Second Grade next year. My classroom of 20 First Graders has really enjoyed getting to know the Letterland characters, each of whom represents a letter of the alphabet with a picture card, sound and story.  \"\"Harry Hatman\"\" who hates noise and \"\"Slippery Snake\"\" who slithers up to \"\"Harry Hatman\"\" only to be told to \"\"Shhh\"\" are two of the favorites. The children are really enjoying the program and are learning from it, but I feel that they could benefit from the program a whole lot more if we had some of the \"\"extras\"\" that the program offers. \r\\n\r\\nThe Living Code Cards would enable me to display the letters, blends, etc. on the screen in my classroom for whole class instruction and discussion by using my \"\"SMART\"\" technology. The individual skills workbooks would enable me to monitor each child's progress as we learn a new skill and catch problems before they get too serious. The action Trick Poster would provide a visual reminder for the students of the multi-sensory memory clues that go with each letter. The Picture Cards and Vocabulary Cards will enable the students to physically maneuver words and letters. The two plays that I requested will enable the children to act out the adventures of some of the Letterland characters. The Storybooks will be great for reading to the children early in the year and hopefully for some of the students to read themselves later in the year. The Dippy Duck DVD will provide reinforcement for the Letterland characters in a fun-filled mystery. The merit stickers would provide rewards for a job well done while reinforcing the Letterland characters. \r\\n\r\\nIf you would fund these extras, it would insure that my students have the best possible chance to get out of the Letterland Program the skills that they need become the kind of readers they need to become by the end of First Grade.

More than 67% percent of our students come from low-income families and poverty-stricken homes. My school is located in a small suburban town that was built upon the textile industry.

The majority of my students will never have the opportunity to leave this city and experience new things. It is an expectation for many of them to join the \"\"blue collar\"\" world by either working in the textile industry or in agriculture. My school is the smallest public high school in the county which means we typically receive a low amount of funding each year. This affects our school library and ultimately affects our students.

If school is the only place my students are going to have  access to books, I want to make sure they have a supple amount to read. I am a huge advocate for literacy.

Audio books will provide a way for my students to hear stories while also reading them! \r\\n\r\\nWe have a mixed population of special education and general education students in one Integrated Co-Teaching setting. My students come from a wide variety of backgrounds. They bring to class a range of experiences, knowledge, and abilities. All of my students work hard to challenge themselves to work towards personal goals for learning and need the tools to help them be successful. \r\\n\r\\nAudio books will provide my struggling readers an opportunity to read books they wouldn't be able to read independently otherwise.  It will allow them the freedom to choose books on interest and engage in book talks with their friends, rather than be stuck with the low level, low interest readers appropriate to their abilities.  It will allow my students to engage meaningfully in the enjoyment of reading, while still gaining practice.  In addition, for my students who can become overstimulated by too much noise or activity or transitions, having a library of audio books will provide them with an outlet to calm down within the classroom but outside of the stimuli that is affecting them.  Having a library of audio books will provide all of the students a way to enjoy stories in a new way, engaging them in hearing stories read with voice and expression when a teacher is unable to model this for them.   \r\\n\r\\nThis project is so important because I have so many struggling readers who get frustrated at the process and audio books will be an incredible incentive to get them reading and enjoying reading again.

I would like to add  new materials to several of the centers.  \r\\nFor example, our listening center needs new books and cds because the children have already heard all of the stories I bought. We also need one more cd player so that the students in my two larger groups don't have to take turns at this center.  This center is the kids' favorite and particularly important to my students who are seldom read to at home. I would also like to get ABC stamps and letter beanbags for the children to use at our letters and word centers.  The students will be able to use these letters to practice writing sight words in a fun way.  Finally, I would like to add a few new educational and fun puzzles and games to these very popular centers, \r\\n\r\\nThe children love \"\"center time\"\".  During center time I work with small groups of  students who have similar needs.   I have found that the success of my small group instruction  is largely determined by  whether the other students are engaged in fun and meaningful activities.  The materials that I have requested will certainly be enjoyed by the students.  As importantly, they will also help reinforce the development of their early literacy skills. Thank you for considering our project. \""}
{"essay":"\"Schools, teachers, and students are not immune from our troubling economic times.  Everyone has had to tighten their belts and do without.  However, education is one thing that our students -- and our country -- cannot skimp on.  Our students need a projector to help them attain their potential. \r\\n\r\\nSince my former teaching position was eliminated this year, I am moving to 4th grade to teach some of my former kindergarteners.  These children bring a lot of energy and excitement to learning.  They have a lot of potential both as learners and as future citizens of our country.  Unfortunately, in rural schools such as ours, students' potential is often stifled due to lack of materials and technology.  As I look at the boys and girls who will be in my class this year, I see future healthcare workers, architects, engineers, lawyers, teachers, etc.  It is of utmost importance that these children have the opportunity to become whatever they are motivated to be.  They are the future and the heart of our nation. \r\\n\r\\nIn my previous teaching position, I received a grant for a similar projector, which was used round-the-clock by numerous teachers.  As I move to 4th grade, the need for another projector in our school is more than evident.  The projector's uses to facilitate learning are innumerable.  It will be used to explore and learn various educational websites and computer programs as a group as well as helping students learn how to wisely use the Internet.  It will enable students to use teacher-made powerpoints and will let them share their own powerpoints with classmates.  It will help students learn how to use technology to further their education and will help spark students' interest in learning.  It will allow students to \"\"beam up\"\" to other places and times and take \"\"field trips\"\" to virtually anywhere.  It will even serve as one of the best methods to teach proofreading skills and how to perform mathematical procedures.  Obviously, the projector's uses are endless. \r\\n\r\\nBesides books, the projector is one of the most effective means of learning our students have today.  Since this projector will be serving approximately 500 students per year and will be used perpetually, this one item will help thousands of students reach their potential and achieve their goals.  Your donation will help these children love learning, experience the world outside of their region, and gain confidence using 21st century technology. \""}

There is no doubt that I will be able to show growth and improvement for 100% of my students. \r\\n\r\\nMy PE department and I are so fired up about the potential this grant has to impact every student at my middle school! It is a perfect fit for support from Chevron and its Fuel Your School grant. I have been testing out different programs and apps available for PE teachers and am confident that our new program will be a success from day 1. Technology is vital to education and PE classes are equally important as well. Please help support every single student at our school with this grant. \""}

It is located in a high-need community in Massachusetts with a growing Hispanic population.\r\\n\r\\nMassachusetts voted to end bilingual education in favor of full English immersion.  While voters chose to end bilingual education, most people knew little about what the studies say on the matter.  In truth, it is incredibly important to foster students' first langauge while they simultaneously learn English.  This class was created to help students transition to college-level classes, but has no supplies whatsoever to aid in the transition.\r\\n\r\\nAll of the studies indicate that it is incredibly important for ESL students to read challenging texts in their native language.

This would involve students reading selected poems, short stories, or plays, discussing the tone and inflection of the voice, and then recording a performance of the reading on cassette tape. \r\\n     Students can then use these tapes in a number of ways. They would have a renewable resource for vocabulary, content, and for comparisons of tone.

When I became a teacher, I realized how rare such opportunities were for my students.  Our robotics team can be that glimpse into the engineering world. \r\\n\r\\nOur robotics team is one of the few urban FIRST Robotics teams in Massachusetts.  Every year, we are responsible for constructing a 200-lb robot, capable of moving at over 15mph, for the FIRST Robotics Competition, a nation-wide engineering competition for high school students.\r\\n\r\\nOur team is around 35 members strong, split between underclassmen, who join the program as an extracurricular activity, and upperclassmen enrolled in the Robotics Engineering class, where they learn to apply their science and mathematics knowledge to solve problems way beyond what they do in the normal classroom.\r\\n\r\\nOur students are not self-selected into the program based on academic merit.  Our goal is to recruit students at all academic levels in order to bolster their academic performance and to inspire them to pursue a career in engineering.  As such, many of the students on the team are those who had been disengaged with school, and our program offers them a way to reengage. \r\\n\r\\nThe resources we have requested are part of our annual operating costs.  Each year, we have fundraise over $3,500 in hardware, metal, electronics, and other miscellaneous components just to build a functioning robot.  Below is an overview of how each item will help our students:\r\\n\r\\n1. Aluminum stock - Our robot is made from aluminum, as the weight limit of the competition dictates the material we use.  Students learn how to work with the metal, such as using a bandsaw and miter saw, as well as how to anodize and weld the metal together.\r\\n2. Hand tools - Students do use power tools, but there's nothing like putting some elbow grease into the robot.  Our tools are all for a standardized set of hardware that our students decided for our robot.\r\\n3. Electronics - Our multimeters and connectors are student requested.  Our students need to learn how to work with the equipment.  In addition, our students designed a quick disconnect electronics platform for our robot with the parts here. \r\\n\r\\nThis project supplies the lifeblood of our team.  Without this equipment, our team would not have the materials in order to compete.  Most of our fundraising efforts are to find donors for the competition entrance fees ($5,000 each year).  Supporting this project will mean that more of our fundraising can be focused on just getting us to the competition itself.  In addition, your support could change the life outcomes of my students, from out of high school with no plan to a future engineer. \""}

For example, we are in need of instrument storage lockers, a stand rack, adequate percussion instruments, general music texts, etc. \r\\n\r\\nThis brings me to my request of a stand rack, in order to make our music room a clean one that students can take more pride in. It will also save space for movement activities in our general music classes. \r\\n\r\\nYour contribution will add another finishing, yet important touch in our music class. It is proven that students learn better in clean, organized classrooms, and they also take better care of and respect those environments that are presented to them in a neat, organized manner. \""}

{"essay":"\"I am a 7th grade Special Education teacher. I am also a Related Arts Team Leader at my school. I co-teach reading and writing in the literacy block. I work in a very diverse school and teach students with various reading and writing levels.  As a special education teacher many of my students cannot read at grade level. It is very frustrating for them to find books at the level they can read and understand while the book is interesting for a young teenager.  My students don't like being seen by their friends with elementary school books, they don't want the book they are reading to embarrass them to their friends. \r\\n\r\\nMany students at my school come from an urban community.  Many of the children in our school have limited resources. Our school is struggling to reach the requirements in reading and writing set forth by No Child Left Behind.  Many students have showed an interest in reading books by Anne Schraff, especially the reluctant boy readers in my class. She writes books that the urban youth can relate to.  I currently do not have enough titles for all of my special education students. Therefore, they are unable to find books at their level that they can be comfortable reading. \r\\n\r\\nThe solution is for me to get titles of books that are at their reading level while being entertaining and cool to read.  Anne Schraff has written many books.  Many of the kids in our general education setting have loved the Bluford Series, of which Anne has written half.  Anne also has written a series of lower reading level Mystery books that contain multicultural characters that our students can relate to.  The plots are full of mysterious twists and turns so struggling readers don't want to put the books down. \r\\n\r\\nWe have a special education population that want to become better readers.  They become better readers by reading, but they need books that they can relate to while the books are on their reading level.  I am requesting just one copy of ten different books at their level.  Our reading block allows all students to read different books, and this donation can give our special education students the opportunity to read ten different books this year.  Please help ensure that NO CHILD GETS LEFT BEHIND!  Our special education students need our love, and they need our books too.  Your donation can help give children the gift of reading.\""}

We got four new bats (not the good ones the players wanted, but bats that fit our budget) and some practice and game balls to get us through the season.

My students need an airline ticket to travel to and from London, England. This opportunity will expose them to new surroundings and allow them to interact with the people, places, and history that they have learned about in class.

Many of my students will be the first generation in their families to both graduate from high school and attend a college or university. Therefore, it is vitally important to me that my students get every opportunity that is readily available to more affluent students and schools. \r\\n\r\\nLondon, England is a vibrant city full of history and culture, and I am in need of funding for the flight to take the students to this amazing location. London and its setting will provide an awe-inspiring backdrop for a variety of activities. Students will have the opportunity to experience both historic and modern London with two days of guided sightseeing in the city, and they will attend a theater performance in London's famous West End neighborhood. They will also get to enjoy authentic English food and culture over our week-long trip.\r\\n\r\\nAmidst these historical excursions, students will be exposed to the true roots of English literature as we visit the homes of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen. Students will visit the prestigious University of Oxford, tour the grounds of Windsor Castle as we learn about the English monarchy, and experience the wonder of Stonehenge. \r\\n\r\\nThis trip is so vitally important for my students. In a year or less, all of these students will be headed to colleges and universities around the country to gain the educational experiences that will help them become leaders in their community.

An opportunity to shine and express themselves to someone who genuinely cares about them and would listen to their ideas and suggestions.  They learn best in an environment where they feel safe and able to take risks without feeling stigmatized. \r\\n\r\\nThe bags that I am requesting will give students an opportunity to share with family members what they are learning in school.  The items that will be in the bags will also support parents with helping at home.  Many parents are not sure how to help their child at home but the contents of these bags will reinforce skills taught at school as well as provide opportunities for quality time with family members because the activities are done together. Students not only learn the value of teamwork but the fact that information can be learned in a fun way. The learning bags are tailored to suit their needs. \r\\n\r\\nFunding this project can break the cycle of illiteracy in some families, touch and change the lives of children forever. When students take these fun filled bags home with books and activities, they will be excited and this enthusiasm will soon spread throughout their home.

Not only is this motivating but they begin to think like scientists by observing, questioning, and making predictions. \r\\n\r\\nThe students will use the requested dissecting trays to keep the dissected frog in one area and make it easier to clean up after the lab. They will then use the pins to pin back the skin that will allow them to observe the organs and organ systems without being distracted by the layers of skin that return to their original position. The gloves are used to keep the students clean while performing the dissection and the different sizes allow for optimum fit for the different size hands that will be performing the dissection.

{"essay":"\"I teach an architecture elective class at a small new, progressive art high school in the Bronx that receives Title One funding. Our students are creative individuals who aspire to successful careers in the art and design fields. Our art classes are often where they will receive their first formal training. \r\\n\r\\nHowever, even with our students taking introductory studio art classes for their first two years of high school, most of my architecture students still have very little experience with understanding how three dimensional objects are built. So every first semester of the architecture course, students learn how materials can be used to assemble a structure. I believe that before they can build their own designs they must understand how structures can stand, connect, contain, and protect. \r\\n\r\\nThis year the class will use paper straws, wire, and glue to build modest objects. I chose the paper straw because it is a versatile and strong material that can be very beautiful in its simple and elegant form. It also mimics modern building components such as beams and pipes. Initially, to give students a chance to quickly become familiar with these materials, they will have a series of short assignments where they build a series of forms: first a solid and an open cube, followed by a Barbie doll scale table and chair. The final challenge will be to design a two color, sturdy box with a removable lid to store their ipod or six compact disks.\r\\n\r\\nI would really love for the class to have lots of materials to use. I believe an abundance of colorful straws of different diameters would inspire students to have rich, imaginative, and playful creations. I have 25 students in a class. I expect each student will need about 350-450 straws. \r\\n\r\\nMany studies have shown that creative play helps students become more successful. The straw project will help my students learn about process and problem solving. It will also give them an opportunity to gain the discipline to work on a project for long and short periods of time. \r\\n\r\\nI also believe if my students can complete the paper straw projects, they will be able to design and build complex and beautiful structures. This will help them start to understand the role of a three dimensional designer in our society. \r\\n\r\\nYour support will help 25 young aspiring architects begin to build their future.

Teaching our students about different areas of the country has been difficult, since many of them have never left our county.

I feel that this is due to the fact that the sports offered to our students require skills that many do not possess.  The only organized sports currently available in our area are football, basketball, soccer and baseball.\r\\nI grew up in Long Island, NY and began playing lacrosse when I was 10 years old and finished up may career at the collegiate level.  It is my belief, from my experiences, that lacrosse is a sport that all children can play.  It does not matter if you are tall or short, large or small, male or female, there is a role that you can play on the lacrosse field, that will give the students a sense of athletic accomplishment.  With the addition of the lacrosse sticks and nets the students will be able to take part in athletics, many for the first time, that will help to build their self esteem.  Inside the classroom students will study the origins of the game going back to the Native Americans use as a war-training tool.  It is through this historical study that the students will learn to appreciate the game.  \r\\nI want my students to have this experience because it is an experience that they will most likely never be exposed to.

I have honor students mixed in with moderate special needs. Some seem to have it all and some seem to have nothing. I have had students bullied to the point of feeling suicidal and others in tears on a weekly basis. Something is wrong in this school and I aim to change it.

Using mp3 players I will first and foremost record step by step directions that coincide with my project goals and objectives that are on printed handouts.

Students who are shy can access information without fear, students who are struggling can access review and help as often as needed, students who are gifted can expand on projects and move into more complex projects when ready.\r\\n\r\\nIndividualized instruction will be paired with self-directed instruction as students use the tools (mp3 players) to access the information they need when they need it leading to more productive work time, independent learning, and focused work habits.

Specific music will be paired with each project. \r\\n\r\\nIt is my hope to inspire students with motivating, up to date technology in the classroom.

{"essay":"\"My greatest fear as an educator is, with growing classroom sizes, to see students slip through the cracks.  I know, because I was that student:  the student who sat in the back of class with her nose in a book and a sincere desire to find more of an identity within the school. I did not find an identity in the school because I was not an athlete, I was not competitive, and I felt overshadowed by those whose talents surpassed mine.  Sure I read a lot, but what did that actively allow me to do in the school setting?  Seeing the shadow of myself so often in the classroom prompted me to initiate something new in our school about four years ago.\r\\n\r\\nOne day, six students approached me after class with an idea:  start a book club that chooses popular teen reads and make it into an active activity.  For example, if we read a book like Thirteen Reasons Why, which tackles social issues like teen suicide and bullying, we take that issue and address it in the community: educate others in the school about the growing number of teen suicides and signs of depression. If we read a book like The Glass Castle, which focuses on a family living in poverty, obtain knowledge about local poverty and visit a food shelf or run a collection.\r\\n\r\\nAfter a few months of reading socially, relevant material and making books an active part of our mission, we decided to name our club \"\"The Extreme Book Club.\"\"  We take the EXTREMEly popular reads among the teen population and relate it to the EXTREME issues in our society. \r\\n\r\\nEach month I have, on average, three new members asking for the latest read and to attend the accompanying activity.  However, due to increased poverty in our community, not every student is able to pay the average cost per book: $10.  Our library cannot fulfill all of the inter-library loan requests for the books either.  The biggest mistake would be to turn these students away from an incredible opportunity to read and make the intangible act of reading become tangible in the community.\r\\n\r\\nYour help will ensure that students who are seeking to be an active participant, but lack the typical skill set necessary to gain entrance into activities, will thrive in the Extreme Book Club.  They can emerge from behind the shadow of their peers and bring what they have learned from books into the community.  I hope that this will always be the plight of education:  make it relevant, make it real, and take it places outside of the schools' doors.  Thank you for your constant support of education! \""}

{"essay":"\"My tenth graders recently spent several weeks devoting themselves to reading and performing parts of their first Shakespearean play, \"\"Romeo & Juliet\"\", (of course). Many of my students read below grade level and come from homes where English is not the first language, so this was no small feat. \r\\n\r\\nReading the play was both daunting and rewarding for the students - while the language and antiquated European context was new to them, they engaged at a high level with the complex motivations of characters entangled in family conflict, not to mention the charged dramas of doomed teenage love.  In the end (and somewhat to my surprise) many of them loved the play. \r\\n\r\\nMy students attend a small public school in a neighborhood just south of Washington's major metropolitan area. The school is incredibly diverse, with hundreds of countries and languages represented. Almost all of my students attend school regularly and care a lot about their learning. \r\\n\r\\nWhile I tried to enrich my students' reading experience by showing film clips and discussing director interpretations of \"\"Romeo and Juliet\"\", I don't think it's possible for the students to fully appreciate or understand Shakespeare without seeing a live performance.  Bringing this touring production to our school would offer students access to discourse about Shakespeare's cultural contributions to today's world, and it would reinforce their literacy experience with the play, bringing the language to life in front of them. The Shakespeare Company in our city has already secured us a grant for most of the funds needed, but we still need to raise the remaining amount to make this possible. \r\\n\r\\nMany of my students have not seen a live performance before - especially not a live Shakespearean performance. This is a rare chance for us to help them experience 'drama' as a literary form, and I believe it could serve as a touchstone experience as they encounter more Shakespeare throughout high school and college. \""}

{"essay":"\"Dear Prospective Donors,\r\\n\r\\nI am so excited to introduce you to my fabulous first graders from Fort Worth, TX!  They are the sweetest, most eager and delightful students you will ever meet.  Although our school is located in an area of the city that has a high concentration of poverty and crime, my students come to school each day dressed in their uniforms and are ready to learn.  Most of my students are struggling to learn English as a second language and over 90% qualify for free or reduced-priced meals. \r\\n\r\\nWe need your help!  We spend 60 minutes each day engaged in small group activities and center work, but we do not have enough materials to teach and reinforce the concepts we are required to learn.  First grade is a pivotal year; it is essential that we master our phonics skills, build vocabulary and increase reading fluency in order to meet the demanding state standards.  \r\\n\r\\nThe good news is, you can make our dream a reality!  We are asking for funding for a variety of age-appropriate literacy games that we can use to master new concepts\/skills and increase our English vocabulary.  My students don't have much, but what they do have, they appreciate and care for.  I know these materials will be cherished by future students for years to come.\r\\n\r\\nI hope you will consider funding our project.  My students need to have engaging materials that stimulate their imagination and teach the required curriculum.  These students do not go home to a cozy house full of books and hi-tech computers.

I have a handful of new students that have been the victims of ineffectual school systems for many years and read at a 3rd-4th grade levels, despite being grade level thinkers. My new students are victims of their circumstance and should be allotted every opportunity for differentiation to make up for their lost educational time. My students want to be the first individuals in their family to go to college. They want to change the wrongs that they see in their community and country. But first, they have to learn how to read and how to think. \r\\n\r\\nRegardless of my student's reading level, I believe they can access the content and skills of our 8th grade ELA class. These students require grade level texts read aloud in order to access the grade level content and learn grade level reading analysis skills. The books on tape will allow my low-readers to access the novel independently in class and at home. This form of differentiation will allow my low-level readers to fully interact with and benefit from the 8th grade ELA curriculum. These students are also receiving basic reading remediation, but it is essential that we build their grade level skills in tandem with their basic reading skills so that, when they finally master the basics of reading, they will be prepared to access grade level texts as high level thinkers. \r\\n\r\\nThis is your chance to give some amazing students a second chance at an excellent education.

Our school is a Title 1 school where most of our students receive free and reduced lunch and our school has very limited funding to purchase us new chairs or books. My students are primarily economically disadvantaged and come from homes where at times even their chairs may be broken, but that is why they are appreciative of the little we have. It simply isn't fair however that here we have 23 students that are willing to sit in broken chairs to be able to obtain an education. Please help us acquire chairs, a storage shelf, and books. \r\\n\r\\nBy obtaining the King Series Books my students will be able to build upon their phonemic awareness. All too often in third grade we have several students that still cannot read and need books like that of the King Series for small groups where they will be able to build their fluency and become better readers. Once they learn how to read they will be able to use the books to write short summaries and teach others good character traits as described within the book. The best part about this project however is that for once my 23 amazing students will be able to sit in a chair where they are no longer distracted with the squeaks, their hair and skin being pinched. They will also learn to clean up and become organized with a new storage shelf for our new books and learn to take responsibility.

Most of the students in the classroom are English Language Learners.  \r\\n\r\\nThey are at risk of giving up on the one skill that could be their ticket to a better life, reading.  The students love being read to.  However, they struggle with independent reading for two reasons.  First, they are extremely uncomfortable.  4th graders are steadily growing.  Many of them are uncomfortable at the desk and find no more comfort in the floor.  After I designated reading spots for everyone they felt like they had a place to call their own.  However, the floor they say is, \"\"dirty,\"\" and \"\"hard.\"\"  The rug is \"\"uncomfortable\"\" and small.  Then when they try to read, they have trouble understanding the text.  Second, at times they can READ the book but that have NO idea what HAPPENED in the book.  They want to get better, but they need the right tools and environment.   \r\\n\r\\nThe students deserve to be able to have sustained reading in a comfortable spot.  Most people would not read for 20-40 minutes on a dirty floor or be able to sit straight up for that time at a desk and read.  At this age, the students need to experience the joys of reading.  Pillows would add to this experience.  They need pillows for the rug and for their reading spots.  This way they can really have a place to read and gain knowledge during the day.

In addition, the reading comprehension centers will allow the students to practice their comprehension skills in partners or small groups.  Good readers use many strategies in order to understand text.  The centers provide this reinforcement and practice.  The stand is to hold the centers because there is no place in the classroom to hold them up.  \r\\n\r\\nPillows and reading centers are things that other schools take for granted.

Due to the diverse needs of my students, I have had to structure my reading program to include literacy workshop stations.  I need to meet in small groups with my students so that they can read books at their instructional level, and so that I can teach them the skills that they need to move to the next level.  When a child is not in a reading group with me, I need to have them engaged in meaningful literacy activities.  I have materials for reading books and writing, but I don't have word study materials.  This is my first year teaching 2nd grade, and I have not acquired the word study materials that my students would benefit from.  The materials that I requested will allow students at all levels to work on word study skills that are going to help them in their reading and writing.  The students will be learning letter sounds, blends, digraphs, word families, etc. \r\\n\r\\nYour donation would help students to spend quality time in quality literacy activities.  You would be helping this generation to be excited about learning.  They will achieve the necessary skills to be successful in school, as well as in their future.  I hope to not just help them to become successful in 2nd grade, but in their future education and in their future lives.  Thank you for helping them get the literacy skills they need, one letter at a time. \""}

That is my class, and most can't read beyond pre-primer.\r\\n\r\\nMy students are AMAZING. They are high schoolers empowered to do their best, but are limited by their intellectual, or multiple disabilities. My class is enrolled in a NYC Specialized School in a high poverty area of the South Bronx. They face cognitive, physical, and emotional challenges that many of us will never have to encounter, everyday. They are brave, resilient, eager to learn, and come to school with a positive attitude each and every day.\r\\n\r\\nDue to their cognitive deficits, and various disabilities compounded by dyslexia, delayed auditory processing, etc., the majority of my students have never learned to read. Those who learned, haven't been able to surpass a third grade level. Most of my students can identify and spell their first and last name, and a few basic sight words, but they are not able to engage in the high school curriculum unless it is read to them. My students, however, are motivated to become readers and can do so with the help of these programs.\r\\n\r\\nWith the addition of new chromebooks in my classroom for next year, and the realization of 1:1 computer to student correspondence, I wanted to utilize this opportunity not only for projects, but for practice with reading. Raz-kids and Headsprout are online interactive, student led programs that will enable each of my students to practice their reading at their own levels and at their own pace. This will be a crucial tool that has never been made accessible to my students. The websites are engaging and thorough and will help to increase motivation for the daunting task of word work and reading comprehension for my students.\r\\n\r\\nWritinga-z and Vocabularya-z are two web-based initiatives that I have used before.

Belle Teal is a children's chapter book that shows the challenges people faced when schools were starting to become integrated in the early 1960's.  Through Belle's actions and emotions, my students will gain a better undertsanding of what it was like to live during that time period.\r\\n\r\\nI teach at a diverse k-8 school in the Chicago Public Schools.  Many of the issues and challenges Belle and her classmates face are ones my students would have dealt with if they lived during that time period.  I believe this book will enhance my students education as well as make a connection between social studies and literature.\r\\n\r\\nIn order to use this book during our civil rights studies, I need a class set of books.  If each child gets to read and follow along in their own copy of the book, they will become much more involved in it.  \r\\n\r\\nI know this book will help my students gain a better understanding of the civil rights movement and I would love to be able to share it with them during the upcoming school year.\""}
{"essay":"\"Can you recall the moment you developed a love for reading?  My students are beginning to appreciate reading; however, there aren't enough books in our classroom library.  I want my students to have a broader variety of books to choose from during independent reading time.  \r\\n\r\\nMy students attend a public charter school in an urban area located in Illinois.  Many of my students reside in lower income communities, and many of their families depend on government assistance.  \r\\n\r\\nOver 95% of my students are African American and receive free lunch.  They are vibrant third graders, highly intelligent, and have a huge appetite for knowledge!  They are like sponges; ready and willing to soak in whatever knowledge comes their way.  They are inquisitive, loving, and a joy to be around. \r\\n\r\\nOne of the major reasons why children don't like to read is because they attempt to read books above their independent reading levels.  I teach my students that choosing a book is similar to shopping for a pair of shoes.  A just-right book is one that \"\"feels\"\" comfortable and also compliments who they are.  \r\\n\r\\nI have requested a leveled library of fiction and non-fiction books to support our balanced literacy program.  Having a leveled library will encourage my students to read even more.  \r\\n\r\\nMy students are at a variety of reading levels, so having books that match their individual independent reading needs will help to build their reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension.  \r\\n\r\\nI will use books from the leveled library for assessment purposes, as well as to teach reading skills and strategies.  Applying the skills\/strategies taught will help my students move to higher reading levels.  This will prepare them for success in other content areas, and at higher grade levels.   \r\\n\r\\nSupporting this project will not only encourage my students to read in school, but to read more at home.  Reading often throughout the day builds reading stamina.  High reading stamina inspires children to develop a love for reading, and prepares students for success with standardized testing.  \r\\n\r\\nThe more children read, the more they learn.  Becoming an avid reader leads to success in life and also encourages lifelong learning.   \""}

The days of working primarily on a chalkboard are long gone.  \r\\n\r\\nI'd love to make a class laptop available to my pupils, along with a multifunction printer. The pupils would be able to print assignments out, create documents, make copies and utilize the Internet. Even though the students would only be able to share access to the machines, the fact that they would get to spend time on it all would be a good starting point to exposing them to all that technology has to offer. \r\\n\r\\nMy students need to be able to utilize any advantage that may come their way.

These anchor charts can then be saved and displayed in the classroom for future use.  \r\\n\r\\nThe children can use their individual white board paddles to share their answers to questions throughout the day.  This will give all of them a chance to share at the same time.  Using the ten-frame on the back of the paddles will help the children improve their Math skills and build number sense.  The children love checking their answers and comparing ideas with one another.\r\\n\r\\nSharing ideas with others helps everyone become better thinkers and allows children to not only learn from the teacher, but more importantly, learn from one another. \r\\n\r\\nHaving an easel and individual whiteboard paddles will allow students to share their ideas for every question.

Although some teachers may stray from the adolescent years, I find these pre-teens challenge me each day to be a better teacher.  They are mature enough to form their own opinions; however, they are still sponges who soak up the information around them.  These students need opportunities to respond to the world around them. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are extremely interested in current events, yet their opinions are often shallow and misinformed.  And, although they love to argue with each other about what's going on around the world, they normally have very little facts to base their opinions on.  A subscription to Weekly Reader's Current Events magazine, a news bulletin designed for teens that unbiasedly addresses the most current political and cultural topics, would give students the facts they need.  My project will fund 30 subscriptions; this means each student will have access to 24 different editions over the course of the year!  Each edition is full of political news, history tidbits, and many interdisciplinary articles.  My writing class is built around student choice; the news magazines will provide ample writing topics for students to explore. \r\\n\r\\nTo paraphrase Tom Stoppard, students are able to change the world through each word they write.

Unfortunately this isn't possible with today's budget cuts, but I can try to provide them with one laptop at a time. \r\\n\r\\nMy students attend an inner city school where all students receive a free lunch. Although there is no extra money for providing technology in the classroom, we try our best to keep up with the times. Unfortunately, with so many students, we do not have enough computers in our classroom to do that. \r\\n\r\\nHaving a new laptop will provide my students with the opportunity to research topics being taught in class, and will also allow them to type and publish their personal writing pieces and research papers. The laptop will be used by all students, and will definitely be utilized in all academic areas. \r\\n\r\\nEveryone knows how it feels to be without technology when it is needed. Whether it be a phone, a computer, or a laptop, technology is necessary when looking up information or learning new things.

{"essay":"\"Help!  Math phobia!  Did you ever try one of those tests that asks you to imagine unfolding an object from 3-D to 2-D, or turning it in your mind?  Now imagine how hard that would be if you had a learning disability.  Add to that the many other challenges facing children living in poverty.  Help! \r\\n\r\\nMy students are delightful, beautiful, loving, and motivated.  That's the great news.  They also live with a lot of bad news.  My students have special needs, such as learning disabilities, attention-deficit disorder, autism, mental retardation, or emotional disturbances.  In addition, they have the challenges of living in a high-poverty and high-crime neighborhood, and most have parents with limited education and difficulty providing their children with the everyday math exposure most of us grew up with.  We live in Texas, with the 2nd-lowest school-funding rating in the nation.  All of my students belong to racial or ethnic minorities, and some are also English-language learners.  Despite the many challenges, and a history of below-average performance on accountability measures, our school's test scores recently earned us our first \"\"recognized\"\" label! \r\\n\r\\nMy students are at a crucial age for mastering basic math concepts.  Our recent professional development program explained research showing how essential it is for students to gain a good understanding of the concepts underlying math, before they can realistically and reliably apply algorithms or formulas.  One important step in concept development is for them to move from using hands-on 3-D manipulatives, to 2-D representations and, finally, to symbolic, numerical representations.  We have used an excellent software program to show students the relationships between base-ten units (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands), and find it helps immensely with this transition, as the 3-D to 2-D representations are very realistic and understandable with this software.  But only one student at a time can view the computer screen.  That is why we desperately need a projector in our resource room, to connect to our computer and allow a small group of students to participate together. \r\\n\r\\nThe only way we can move toward equal opportunity and justice in our nation is through excellent education.  Underprivileged children have so many strikes against them, and using research-based practices can offer them a fighting chance.  Technology is especially hard to come by for them, and particularly motivating and enlightening.  Hewlett-Packard is currently matching donations of H-P products, so your donation impact will be doubled, cutting the cost of this projector in half. \""}
{"essay":"\"Can spelling be fun? Many of my students have already developed spelling phobias and negative attitudes towards their ability to spell. It becomes my first and most important task to turn that attitude around and develop self-confidence and a willingness to take risks. Games make spelling fun. \r\\n\r\\nSince our inception, my school has been dedicated to educating the whole child by offering a rich dynamic educational program. Our school is an exciting alternative to traditional schools. We are based on developmentally appropriate teaching methods that accommodate the whole child with respect to individual learning styles, developmental readiness, and rates of achievement. \r\\n\r\\nMultiple-age classrooms, collaborative teaching, a high level of parent participation, and community involvement greatly contribute to developing us into a world class learning community. Our innovative programs are designed to accommodate the diverse needs of all students, including those who are historically underachieving or academically disadvantaged, to challenge and engage students to master state academic content and to meet or exceed state achievement standards. \r\\n\r\\nA.A. Milne once said, \"\"My spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places.\"\" When children are having fun they are more open to learning. They are willing to take risks. Hands-on materials and spelling games provide a motivating way to excite students while they learn necessary skills. Many children fear making spelling errors and so they settle on a safe word, and enormous becomes big. \r\\n\r\\nI want my students to overcome that fear. By building my students' vocabulary and spelling skills they will gain confidence in writing. I have many students who are learning English as a second language and these materials will help them with vocabulary comprehension. \r\\n\r\\nBy introducing games into a spelling lesson, concepts become interactive and much less intimidating. Games encourage critical thinking, and problem-solving, as well as basic skills. By building confidence, spelling skills improve and make all the difference for a struggling student. \r\\n\r\\nMy students need games and center materials to build knowledge and thus confidence. Spelling games that introduce vocabulary and word families help bridge gaps and provide comprehension. Hands-on material will help develop a solid foundation of core concepts. Fun is a springboard to motivation. Please help me turn tedious  and monotonous into words my students can spell, but no longer associate with their spelling lessons. \""}
{"essay":"\"I teach ESL for grades K-4. We are in a school with high needs and low income-most are on free lunch. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are low income.

Most have little resources for education to call their own. \r\\n\r\\nFor the students to have their own weekly magazines to bring home and call their own would allow easy access for reading with all its skills and the children could share their magazines with their parents and siblings, who usually have no reading materials.  The students can carry their magazines everywhere and can use skills such as highlighting,coloring, cutting, and write in books activities.  All of this at their fingertips to call their own.

Though some of them are reading to learn while others are learning to read, we are a class who genuinely enjoy reading.  With the students' passion for reading, and materials to practice with, in no time, reading comprehension will be much easier for us. That's why we really need the magazines. \r\\n\r\\nThe Scholastic magazines and Times for Kids will be used in the classroom and at home to practice for reading , researching, and writing. First, the students will read the magazines and relate to the themes that they are learning in their reading curriculum. Second, they will use the magazines to discuss the themes with their partners in class. Then, they will bring the magazines home to do a research project on a related topic. Finally, they will be scrutinizing at the mechanics and grammar of the text to help them understand how writings are being done. \r\\n\r\\nThe magazines are crucial to the students' learning.

{"essay":"\"I am a teacher at an elementary school where there is large population of ESL students. I am  a fifth grade teacher who works in a departmentalized setting.  I am responsible for teaching mathematics to fifth and sixth graders.  \r\\n\r\\nNinety percent of my students are economically disadvantaged.  Less than fifty percent of my students are proficient readers.  The majority of my students are Hispanic.  Many of my students and their parents are not proficient in English. Not having age appropriate books in english at home, or in the classroom only hurts the students.    \r\\n\r\\nAs a fifth grade teacher in a departmentalized setting sometimes I do not receive all of the same resources other teachers receive.  I teach mathematics so I received all the math materials and manipulatives I need.  In an effort to help my students meet their reading requirement of reading at least 40 books by June, I am asking for a functional classroom library. The library would promote literacy and help me to reinforce reading.  Reading and math go hand and hand. \r\\n\r\\nProviding my students with a functional classroom library would mean helping my students become proficient in reading.  It would also mean that they will be that much closer to meeting and exceeding the district standard of reading forty books prior to the June deadline.  It would encourage recreational reading and may even impact the way the students feel about reading in a positive way. There are many ways that this library can impact my students but it can also benefit the school. If more students score proficient in reading on their test because of your generous donation, you could possibly contribute to the total school population making Adequate Yearly Progress.\""}

I make a point of encouraging my students to share their thinking about different math and science projects, and these students love to oblige.  Whenever I ask students to present what they have learned I am overwhelmed by the students responses.

Overhead projectors, like the one we currently have, are large, clunky machines that can only be used with transparent materials. This means that I am really limited as to what I can project for students.  Yes, I can write and do math, but beyond these two basic tasks I am pretty limited.  This document camera would allow me to easily show students live science experiments, and it's time lapse function would even allow me to capture long term experiments, like showing plant growth, to really help students see changes over time.  This tool would also allow students to show their work to the class without having to re-write it.

Students will be able to present 3-D objects more easily, and will be able to manipulate items to teach their peers live using the document camera. \r\\n\r\\nCurrently, my students have a hard time sharing with their peers, difficulties and limitations I share because of our overhead.  Getting a document camera will remove these roadblocks and open up a whole new world to my students.

{"essay":"\"My students may be \"\"at-risk,\"\" but they excel at solving hands-on problems.    Roller coasters are a motivating way to demonstrate physical principles and link theory to application.  This kit will allow them to design and implement meaningful experiments about motion. \r\\n\r\\nMy students range in age between 14 and 20.  They are all high school students working toward graduation.  We are an \"\"alternative\"\" school for students who have not been successful at a typical high school.  This often means that they are perceived as \"\"bad\"\" kids, but it really means that they think \"\"outside the box,\"\" a wonderful attribute for science students!  \r\\n\r\\nMany of my students battle with depression, anxiety, homelessness, poverty, hunger, and sometimes families with criminal or drug involvement.   In our small school environment (125 students in high school), each student can find a niche where they can demonstrate their abilities and learn by doing.   Many of our graduates go on to college.  When we figure out what turns a kid on, he or she will amaze us! \r\\n\r\\nThe K'nex Roller Coaster physics kit includes designs with loops, turns, twists and hills.  Physical Science begins with a study of motion.  Speed, acceleration, momentum, centripetal acceleration, gravity, energy and conservation of energy are concepts the students must learn.  When small groups of students build their own roller coasters, we can design experiments comparing each creation on each concept as we study it.  The Law of Conservation of Momentum, for example, governs what happens when two roller coaster cars collide!  Students can predict outcomes, then try them out using this kit.\r\\n\r\\nStudents often confuse concepts.  For example it is hard to distinguish between the concepts of speed and acceleration.  With this kit, we can measure the constant speed of a car moving on a straightaway and measure  the acceleration it experiences as it goes around a turn or downhill.  By actually working with the physical reality, it is much easier to distinguish between the concepts. \r\\n\r\\n\r\\nMy students need motivation!  Most have experienced failure after failure in school and want to give up.  When they have academic successes it brings them new hope and motivation to pursue graduation.  When they relax and have fun as they learn, they combat the depression, anxiety and frustration that has haunted their lives.  I have seen miracles -- and this equipment will facilitate some more. \""}

{"essay":"\"\"\"I want to fit in and have friends!\"\"\r\\n\r\\nThis is a phrase I hear a lot as a teacher of students with autistic spectrum disorders.  They realize that they don't fit in at times and they want to know how it should be done. Often, their thinking is methodical and behaviors must be spelled out for differing environments. These students benefit from examples of \"\"what to do\"\" in every possible situation, because transference of behavior is limited in their minds.  \r\\n\r\\nMost of the time they require explicit instruction on the steps of implementing a social skill in a different place other than where it was taught. Generally speaking, I have found that because these students have such great memories, they readily learn new information and retain it for future reference.  What becomes difficult for me as a teacher is making sure I cover what the skill would look like in a different setting.\r\\n\r\\nMy students want to fit in and make friends.  They are nice kids, but they appear different than other students.  The apparent difference isn't caused by physical abnormalities.  It is caused by their lack of training in social mimicry.  Growing up, children learn social norms, facial expressions and behavior from watching what other people do.  My students currently lack the skills necessary to take on the perspectives of other people. \r\\n\r\\nThese skills are needed to function independently in community life, as well as at school.  These are skills we use to make friends.  Lacking the skill of being able to use facial expression creates a barrier between students with autism and making friends.   It is difficult for the students to imitate facial expression for various situations because as one student once said \"\"he feels blank.\"\"  They must learn what expressions apply to situations in school, in the community and at home.  \r\\n\r\\nHaving a digital camera and funds for digital photo processing would allow our class the opportunity to take pictures of real life situations.  They could take pictures of themselves or other people.  The photos will be able to capture facial expressions associated with situations and emotions.  They will learn how to assimilate their own expressions with what is expected for those occasions\r\\n\r\\nVisual learners find visual aids, such as photographs, a great resource for learning new information. I have found that most students with autistic spectrum disorders are visual learners.  In the year 2000, for every 1,000 people, there were 2 people with autism.  Now the numbers have changed.  Today, one out of 150 people are diagnosed on the spectrum.  That is a drastic increase. As a teacher, I am trying to utilize technology to teach these students skills they need.  The goal is to help them learn skills now, so they can function in our society.\""}

These books will make the stories of weather & physics come alive, filling my students with a wealth of knowledge and stimulate their drive to learn more. \r\\n\r\\nMy 6th graders pour into the room ready to find out more...we challenge ourselves to go beyond, to look for answers beyond the questions at the back of the chapter...to experiment, question and wonder.  They ask me all sorts of questions I don't necessarily know the answer to but instead turn it into a learning experience where we jointly look for the answer.\r\\nWe are the youngest grade level in a middle school (6th-8th grade) and our school is about 40 years old.  Since we live in Kansas, they are naturally curious about weather, especially tornadoes.  We build on that connection to the real-world and learn how convection currents, density and energy move in the atmosphere & in the oceans.  They come to see it isn't just about Kansas, it's about how the whole world works together as a big system.\r\\nMy students love to connect what they see on TV news or the Internet with what we do in class.  Learning more about the world in which they live. \r\\n\r\\nOur library is very old and the nonfiction collection is very meager.  This grant will enable us to have literature circles within our science class and give reading materials to enrich the textbook.\r\\nTextbooks are great resources, but well written nonfiction books like Into the Storm and Hurricane Force  provides another way for them to learn to read expository texts that are more engaging.  Buying multiple copies will allow me to use these within each lab group, giving students the chance to process each topic with new reading strategies....just like their literature circles in reading class.  The Into the Storm CD will also allow me to bring the author's voice into the classroom as they listen to the more difficult passages being read aloud.\r\\nThe Cartoon Guide to Physics gives me a different way to introduce this normally intimidating subject to 11 year Olds...they are immediately drawn into cartooning about the concepts never realizing they are working with hard topics.\r\\n \r\\n\r\\nYour generosity will allow students to learn about science through enriched materials they don't have access to otherwise as well as provide books for when we have free science reading time.\r\\nI will be able to teach them, by using these books, nonfiction reading strategies beyond what I can do with just a textbook.  This will lead them to a lifelong skill which can be used in high school and beyond...and expose them to a genre of literature that is new. \""}

For the student who does not speak English they can use the language tutor and headphones to help them learn new words.  The language tutor can go home as homework to help the whole family learn the language.  For the student who knows English, it can be used as a tool to help build a community and friendship between the two students.  It can also be used to teach how important it is to help others. \r\\n\r\\nThis project will help many students who struggle to relate to one another to become a closer community.  A classroom is much more than reading, writing, and arithmetic--it's a family.  And English is much more than a language. \""}

I've had it in my classroom for so many years, it's impossible to get it clean. Secondly, it is so worn in some spots, it's hard to be comfortable when reading or learning. A cozy, new carpet wouldn't just brighten the atmosphere of the classroom, but also the little, happy faces. \r\\n\r\\nThe space we have in our classroom is limited. My students sit at tables, which means they do not have a designated desk space for their materials. Currently we set the table folders, crayons, and pencils in the center of the table, which is also  the working spot for 3-4 children. First and second graders need a large, organized area to be successful workers. Pockets on their chairs would free up table space. They would also give the children easy access to their materials. They will learn that the more organized you are, the better you perform. Having materials close by, will not waste any of our instructional time searching for items. \r\\n\r\\nOur classroom will be improved in a couple ways. First, my class will be more organized and ready to work to the best of their ability. Making good use our learning time, has always been a priority for us. Having easy access to our materials and allowing more work space at our table, will ensure positive learning. \r\\n\r\\nSecondly, everyone achieves better results at work when their comfort level is high.

Our middle school has three schools within itself: the magnet, the school of advanced studies, and the host school.  I teach in the host school where the majority of my students qualify for Title I.  I believe that this proposed plan of instruction will boost their academic motivation.  I would love the opportunity to affirm their desires to learn outside of the classroom by going on a field trip.    \r\\n   For our response to literature unit, I am planning to use the theme of migration to address California state standards in history and language arts.  I would like to purchase a class set (36 novels) of  Esperanza Rising. This novel is not only culturally relevant, but academically engaging as well.   In addition, a field trip to the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance exhibit on immigration would enrich their historical understanding of why different groups migrate from one homeland to another.  I plan to take all 68 of my students on this trip.  \r\\n   This novel and exhibit experience has the potential to inspire my students to be critical and self reflective thinkers in a new way.  I think it will have a profound effect on their scope of understanding, and be a gateway to aid them in their culminating projects: an autobiographical account of their own story of migration.

{"essay":"\"Help arm us for our upcoming Battle of the Books! Our teams have set a great tradition of careful reading and spirited discussions enabled by generous donations from DonorsChoose. With multiple copies of these titles we'll be able to fully prepare for this year's Battle of the Books! \r\\n\r\\nFifteen 7th and 8th grade students meet weekly after school to discuss and capture the details of the Battle of the Books titles.  Our students live in the inner city of a major US city and attend a public school where they study a world language starting in Kindergarten.  All but one of these students are stepping up to this intellectual leadership position for the first time.  Most of the students who were on our 4th - 6th grade team have left our school to attend middle schools with accelerated programs.  It's exciting to see these students taking the risk of joining the Battle of the Books team and assuming greater responsibility for perseverance, leadership and research.  They are making a commitment to read 21 books, and to become experts on three of them. Expertise is developed by reading these books at least twice. The enthusiasm these students express about the books they are reading has a powerful influence on the other upper grade students who also get to read the books. \r\\n\r\\nOur library budget has been slashed. Under better circumstances we can purchase at least one copy of each book but that has not been possible this year. I have single copies of only 6 of the books on the list.  Having multiple copies of the books on the Battle of the Books list makes it so much easier for students to read and discuss each year's books.  Having multiple copies not only reduces stress, but contributes enormously to the atmosphere of literacy. Because these books are cataloged in our collection, these multiple copies remain available for all students and remain in circulation for years to come.  Past titles have been among our highest circulating titles; these multiple copies encourage a social dimension to our students' independent reading. \r\\n\r\\nLast year, both of our Battle of the Books teams qualified for the city-wide finals.  We'd like to repeat this accomplishment.  Participation brought out the best in both reading, conversation and discussion. Students ability to co-operate as a team grew significantly. I'd like to see those same opportunities afforded to a new group of students.  Multiple copies of the Battle of the Books titles will make it so much easier  to develop and maintain momentum and succeed in our goals.  \""}

{"essay":"\"I teach Chemistry in an inner-city magnet school that has a law focus.  Our law focus makes us a one-of-a-kind school in our area.  We are preparing students to attend college to study law or enter careers in law-related fields.  Many students are interested in becoming attorneys, police officers, FBI agents, and forensic scientists.  Other students have not yet settled on a career field and are participating in internships and extra-curricular activities to help them narrow their focus.   \r\\n\r\\nI like to incorporate aspects of forensic science into my Chemistry course.  This is an appropriate way to make Chemistry relevant to students.  My students are much more engaged in the learning process when they are able to see a real-world connection to the scientific concepts.  Labs also increase general interest in science and encourage more students to seek out degrees and careers in science. \r\\n\r\\nWith your help, my students will be able to complete two separate toxicology crime labs. One lab is a start-to-finish analysis of a drug bust including urine, fingerprint and handwriting analysis to determine the identify of the drug distributor.  The other lab helps students to determine the identity of the substance that caused a foodborne illness.  The crime scene tape is an extra detail that will make the labs more realistic and exciting.\r\\n\r\\nIn addition to increasing student interest in chemistry and forensic science, labs also improve critical thinking and writing skills.  By logically thinking through a problem to find a suitable solution, students are able to develop critical thinking skills that are invaluable in college and work.\r\\n\r\\nAt the end of every lab experience, students are required to write a complete lab report explaining the purpose, materials, methods\/procedure, and results of the lab.  These are graded for content as well as writing skills such as grammar, spelling, sentence structure and organization.  By learning how to write a lab report in high school, students will be well prepared for college where this is a mandatory part of the lab experience. \r\\n\r\\nBy donating to this proposal you will make it possible for my students to experience Chemistry in a realistic way.  Experiments create long-lasting fun memories for students and also make scientific concepts permanently \"\"stick.\"\"  \""}

Four years ago I started a guitar class with ten of my students as part of the Little Kids Rock Program. This class has become very popular among students and I constantly receive many requests from students of different grade levels wanting to be part of this special class. Due to the limited amount of instruments I am unable to provide more students with the opportunity to learn how to play a modern band instrument and use their creative energy to write original songs. \r\\n\r\\nIn order to improve and provide music lessons to more students in my school I need additional technology. The tablet will give access to more students who have shown great interest in creating original recordings.. Students in this project will not only learn musical skills, but they will also be learning about the importance of cooperation and teamwork. Students will be performing at special events such as: assemblies, holiday programs, and talent show. Performances will not only build self-esteem and confidence, but it will also inspire other students and the rest of the community to explore their culture through music. \r\\n\r\\nYour generous donation will make it possible for my students to learn how to record their original compositions and use their creativity to express themselves through music.

There are about 125 students that will be impacted by having a computer for the students to incorporate photographs in their artwork.\r\\n\r\\nHaving a computer would allow students to manipulate artwork to draw from, create artwork in multimedia form with software such as Photoshop, occasionally the students need text in artwork with a good base of color that would greatly enhance the students finished product as well as keeping their interest in new art forms. \r\\n\r\\nAn example of how the computer would be used by a student would be to make a composition of their color pencil drawings and photographs and they would put it into Photoshop and make a collage by rearranging the photos in the computer program until it had the correct balance and perspective.  Then they could draw their picture from the collage.\r\\n\r\\nSeveral of these students may become graphic artists and will be using computers with their natural art abilities for layouts of book covers to television advertising campaigns. They will be able to create dazzling artwork so they can be competitive in art contests. In the future some of the skilled artists may even use the computer to create large works that hang in the museums, galleries or even Pine Tree High School halls.\r\\n\r\\nCreating art with a computer and creating art with a brush or a pen are at the same time both similar and different.

{"essay":"\"Have you ever seen a child in the grocery store throwing a tantrum and wonder why the parents are not doing anything about it?  Maybe you have seen a class on a field trip and a teacher seems to be struggling with one single student.  What about a student who just can't seem to get the right answer? \r\\n\r\\nChildren with disabilities struggle to express themselves in academics and social situations.  I am a special education teacher in the 10th largest school district in the nation.

With the adoption of Common Core State Standards to push students to college and career readiness, students with disabilities continue to struggle even more.  Students are expected to acquire more knowledge at a younger age.  For students with disabilities, as much exposure to academics and social skills in as many various manners, is necessary to allow for practice and acquisition of skills.  While many students are able to acquire these skills through peer and teacher interactions, students with Autism struggle to make those social connections. \r\\n\r\\nImagine looking through a store window everyday to see the thing you want most in the world, but never being able to touch it.

I have a work-issued IPAD that I used to monitor student progress, coordinate meetings, provide teacher feedback, track student data, and access student information.  Although it is a great resource and tool, I cannot put it in the hands of those who most need it: the students.  I have already been able to acquire Big Grip to protect the outside of the IPAD, IPAD crayons for touch screen fine motor skills, and multiple research based apps that demonstrate improvements in academics and social skills for students with disabilities.  Allowing an IPAD in the hands of a student, opens doors for differentiated instruction, direct feedback, self-correction, and interactions.  Students with disabilities struggle with day to day skills, and the smart technology of an IPAD is just one accommodation to make learning accessible for all. \r\\n\r\\nCommon Core State Standards push students to college and career readiness.  While students with disabilities struggle to understand concrete skills, abstract skills are even more difficult to grasp.

They're almost exclusively Latino, many of them first-generation Americans aiming to be the first in their families to go to college.  They like to learn, yet most of them know so little about the world around them, and in turn, feel less than empowered to be major players in shaping that world.  Our school is a public charter high school in California with about 550 students, a place that is providing neighborhood kids a great education that they deserve. \r\\n\r\\nWe're often exposed to the history of our most well-recognized communities.  Here in Los Angeles, we often come across old pictures of Beverly Hills and Hollywood, stories with nostalgia that fills up books.  The places where recent immigrants often end up, though, are much less documented.  The Florence-Firestone neighborhood in South Los Angeles has been a shifting landscape of immigrants and other Americans for the last century, and our students will be interviewing those people who live here now to hear the stories of how they arrived.  They'll also be researching the community's past to find and interview those who lived here before.\r\\n\r\\nThese Flip cameras will be a tool that we can use for years to come to build and expand a library of community history--something that is often neglected in a community where people are working so hard just to make it.  This neighborhood is a part of the fabric of Los Angeles, and it would be amazing for our students to help document its history. \r\\n\r\\nThis project has so many purposes, it is astounding.  The presentation of these interviews will happen in concert with a student\/staff performance of the play \"\"Our Town\"\" in Spanish and English.

Every time they need markers or scissors or whiteboards we need to take valuable learning time to get up and get those items or wait until they are distributed. By having the necessary items close at hand (stored in the back of students' chairs) we can reclaim 30 - 45 minutes a day of our learning time! That's up to 225 minutes a week! That's time better spent working on reading, writing, math and problem solving skills. \r\\n\r\\nThe chair pockets will also help to create more independence in my Kindergarten students. They won't need to ask the teacher for materials they use on a daily basis anymore! \r\\n\r\\nOrganization makes any task smoother and more efficient. Chair pockets will help my students become more organized and help us take back valuable time lost which could be used for learning activities. Your donation will allow my Kindergarten students to put more of their school day to the best use...spent in learning, exploration and discovery. \""}
{"essay":"\"Close your eyes and go on a magical adventure into the land of books - the 21st century book - an eReader! My students can use all the motivation possible to get them into reading and out of their reality. \r\\n\r\\nMy students are mostly tenth graders taking English 2. I also have one class of freshmen in English 1. Many of these students are following Louisiana's Career Diploma track, and English is their worst\/least favorite subject. \r\\n\r\\nMost of my students come from high poverty homes in which education may not be supported due to parents with limited education themselves. The students come from various socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, races, and academic abilities. They live in a farming community in South Louisiana, so many years, their education is disrupted by hurricanes and other weather disasters. \r\\n\r\\nMy students have the potential to be strong readers, and really have a spark when introduced to literature in which they are interested. With the new Common Core state standards, I would love to be able to really spark my students' love of reading and learning so they can meet the standards' high expectations. \r\\n\r\\nI am requesting a set of eleven Kindle Ereaders for use in my classroom. These Ereaders will allow me to upgrade my English class to the 21st century with paperless literature. \r\\n\r\\nAs a class, we will be able to explore new places, cultures, and time periods with the touch of a button. Students will be able to choose reading selections at their reading level on a confidential basis; struggling readers will be able to define unknown words; more advanced readers can annotate and mark up a text that they otherwise would not be able to write in. \r\\n\r\\nIf we receive these Kindle eReaders, students will be able to use them for silent sustained reading every morning and during our intervention period after lunch. We would also incorporate them into group activities that encourage finding support for claims made in writing, one of the biggest skills needed for Common Core and state testing. Other technology can be connected to the eReaders, so students can share thought processes and include all in the learning process. \r\\n\r\\nReading is one of the most important skills a student needs. It is needed in all areas of life, at all ages, and no matter a person's education level. \r\\n\r\\nI want my students to become proficient and effective readers who can analyze a text and support what they believe. More so, I want to instill a love for reading so that it doesn't feel like a task, but a pleasure. eReaders will help bridge the gap that is left in students who have admittedly never read a book on their own.  \""}

We are a high needs school, and really need to focus on raising our STAR test scores.\r\\n\r\\nSecond grade is basically a make it or break it grade as far as reading goes. Most students who do not master the skills of reading by the time they exit second grade have a high chance of struggling the rest of their educational career. I have a passion for literacy, and I try to reach all of my students-especially those who are below level. My classroom consists of a leveled library, where students read from a book bin containing books they choose-that match a book shopping card I give them. Many of my second graders come in reading at Levels E and F, which are beginning first grade levels. As I leveled my library last year, I found that it is severely lacking the above levels. This means my students have VERY limited choices when book shopping for their level. Currently, I get books for them in our book room, which some of them don't like because I give them their books, and they never get to book shop with their classmates.\r\\n\r\\nIn this proposal, not only am I asking for a set of 25 books in both levels E and F, but I am also asking for library book pockets and 3x5 cards.

Poetry in the classroom can increase language development through its rhythm and rich language. \r\\n\r\\nNothing can compare to the look on a student's face when they start reading.  As an educator, it is my job to foster students' learning and encourage them to succeed.  I also encourage students to practice their reading at home, which does become challenging for many of my students because they do not have books at home.  Many parents in our population work or do not have access to vehicles, which makes taking trips to the local library challenging and virtually impossible.  Part of this project would allow students to take home their poems to practice their reading.  \r\\n \r\\nI teach first grade students in a Title 1 school who have a strong desire to learn. I try to create an environment that fosters learning and provides students with the encouragement they need to succeed.  Our school has a very diverse population, which includes many English Language Learners.  Seventy-five percent of the student population receives free or reduced lunch. \r\\n\r\\nStudies have shown that poetry aides students with their reading and writing.  My students go to various literacy stations daily to practice skills that will help them with learning how to read and write. During station time, I am working with small groups providing guided reading instruction.  I have not had a poetry station before but this year I would like to start.  The poetry books will provide students with mentor texts so they know what different forms poetry can take, as well as provide our class with read alouds.  The ebooks will provide 2-3 poems per week that enable the students to practice their reading, look for familiar onsets and rhymes, enhance fluency, practice rhyming words, and read with expression. The ebooks that have been requested go along with various themes and words studies that we work on daily.  After students have completed the work with each poem, the poems will be added to the students' poem books and then taken home for reading practice. \r\\n\r\\nI believe that through working with poetry, students can gain important skills that develop literacy.  Students can take away the ability to read and write poetry which can enhance their overall fluency in reading and writing.  It is important for students to gain a strong background in reading at a young age because reading is a strong foundation for learning other subject areas.

{"essay":"\"I am a second year, first grade general education teacher in a high need community of the South Bronx, New York.\r\\n\r\\nMy six year olds are great but boy can they get off-task!  The majority are greatly unorganized and like to talk!  I'm looking for a way to keep my students organized and on task during center time and throughout the day.\r\\n\r\\nThe Time Tracker I am asking for is a timer that is shaped like a stoplight.  It is a visual reminder for my students letting them know when they need to complete their assignments.  The Yacker Tracker allows for me to set a certain decibel and my students will know when they are too loud.  It is also in the shape of a stop light that allows for a visual reminder for my students.  The highlighter tape center and refills will help my students focus in on the words they are studying during center time as well as allow me to highlight the words in our stories.  This will particularly be used in our poetry center where students currently use markers and crayons.  Lastly, the organization station pocket chart will allow my students to keep all their papers out of their desk and easily accessible.  This will allow me to have more instructional time because I will be able to have a student pass back papers quickly into this chart instead of walking around the room looking for the student's desk.\r\\n\r\\nI hope you find my cause worthy.  My students and I need your help to keep us organized and on task!\""}

{"essay":"\"As a 4th grade reading teacher at a low performing school, in a huge state testing year, my students need to do a lot of reading.  We have time for independent reading every day but we have a huge problem.  We have very few books in our classroom library. \r\\n\r\\nThe students in my 4th grade reading class come from a very high poverty area in the inner city of Miami, Florida.  Many of them do not have access to books at home and our classroom library is very small. Our school is considered to be a failing school mostly due to the low levels of students achievement in areas such as literacy. We are working towards improvement and helping the students to realize all the potential that they have.  My students have huge dreams and goals; from wanting to be a professional football player to becoming a judge.  However, without resources like books, my students are at a huge disadvantage.  They all know that in order to achieve these goals they must go to college.  Although they are only in the 4th grade, this is the time for them to become lifelong learners and readers. \r\\n\r\\nOur small classroom library needs books to help my students discover the types of books they are interested in and to help them learn to love reading.  My students will use these books to read during independent reading time and also to bring home with them.  Since my students reading scores are so low, every book and every opportunity they have to read can only help them grow.  Most of my students have never left their neighborhood and do not know much about the world\/social studies\/current events.  Since there is very little time in our schedule to teach these subjects, Time For Kids is a great way for them to learn about the world around them while also improving their reading skills. They will read Time For Kids for homework and in class and then answer reading comprehension questions about the articles. \r\\n\r\\nWith your help, my students will have access to more books and information about the world, which will hopefully help them improve their reading skills and motivate them to read more.  Thanks to you, my 4th graders can have a chance at learning the skills they need to help set them on a pathway to success for the rest of their lives. \r\\n\"\"\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009cThe more that you read, the more things you will know.

{"essay":"\"In California, where the budget crisis rules the school boards, music is the first subject to be placed on the chopping block of budget cuts.  \r\\n\r\\nI teach middle school band (grades 6-8), and encourage students to express themselves through music. We are a low-income school that is only 2 years old.\r\\n\r\\nBecause we are a low-income school, we have a genuine need for supplies.  This is magnified by the fact that we are a new school, finishing out our second year.  What this means is that we still need many resources for a fulfilling educational experience, but with the budget cuts we have no way of buying the items we need.  \r\\n\r\\nMy students are reading more and more complex pieces of music, and we are now at the point where it is important to use different tone colors during the piece.  When the piece of music calls for trumpet mutes, my class uses small red plastic cups to create a similar effect.  This is something that the students could be embarrassed about if we play this piece in a public performance. As an educator, I feel that it is imperative to protect the students' emotional well-being, and provide them with the proper equipment necessary to play the music in the way it was intended to be played (which means not using plastic cups).  \r\\n\r\\nWhat I am asking for is a set of 6 straight mutes for trumpet, as well as 6 corresponding mute stands that can be attached to the music stands.   I feel that this will enable the students to feel more confident about their musical sound.  They will also gain an important aural experience regarding tone color that a straight mute can provide.\r\\n\r\\nBy contributing to this worthy cause, I know that you will empower my students to feel more musically able.  They will feel like they are taken more seriously as musicians.  Also, they will be able to understand that there are people in the world who are willing to extend their hands and help those in need without expecting anything in return except a \"\"thank you.

I wouldn't have to hunt up items to place on the science table to feature these topics.  It has fun and interesting items to attract students to want to play, touch, and experience the world of science.  \r\\n\r\\nThe Color Discovery Tubes are an absolute blast.  I have tried to replicate them using empty soda bottles without success.  There is just something fun about shaking a tube and mixing two colors to create a whole new color.  It also helps us learn about primary and secondary colors.\r\\n\r\\nThe Big View Magnifier allows for little hands to check out our world (and objects in the new Instant Science Trays) up close and personal.
